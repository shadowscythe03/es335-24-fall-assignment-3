you are a lover of understanding i wont <newline> deceive you the masters of these schools are not to blame who think <newline> it necessary to be mad with mad men for unless they teach what their <newline> scholars approve they might as cicero says keep school to <newline> themselves like flattering smellfeasts who when they come to great <newline> mens tables study nothing more than what they think may be most <newline> agreeable to the company as well knowing they shall never obtain what <newline> they would unless they first spread a net for their bars so a master <newline> of eloquence unless fisherman like he bait his hook with what he <newline> knows the fish will bite at may wait long enough on the rock without <newline> hopes of catching any thing <newline> where lies the fault then parents ought to be sharply reprehended <newline> who will not have their children come on by any strict method but in <newline> this as in all things are so fond of making a noise in the world <newline> and in such haste to compass their wishes that they hurry them in <newline> publick eer they have digested what they have read and put children <newline> eer they are well past their suckingbottle upon the good grace of <newline> speaking than which even themselves confess nothing is greater <newline> whereas if they would suffer them to come up by degrees that their <newline> studies might be temperd with grave lectures their affections <newline> fashiond by the dictates of wisdom that they might work themselves <newline> into a mastery of words and for a long time hear what theyre <newline> inclined to imitate nothing that pleasd children woud be admird <newline> by them. but now boys trifle in the schools young men are laughd at <newline> in publick and which is worse than both what every one foolishly <newline> takes up in his youth no one will confess in his age. but that i may <newline> not be thought to condemn lucilius as written in haste i also will <newline> give you my thoughts in verse <newline>  <newline> who ere woud with ambitious just desire <newline> to mastery in so fire an art aspire <newline> must all extreams first diligently shun <newline> and in a settled course of vertue run <newline> let him not fortune with stiff greatness climb <newline> nor courtierlike with cringes undermine <newline> nor all the brother blockheads of the pot <newline> ever persuade him to become a sot <newline> nor flatter poets to acquire the fame <newline> of i protest a pretty gentleman <newline> but whether in the war he woud be great <newline> or in the gentler arts that rule a state <newline> or else his amorous breast he woud improve <newline> well to receive the youthful cares of love <newline> in his first years to poetry inclind <newline> let homers spring bedew his fruitful mind <newline> his manlier years to manlier studies brought <newline> philosophy must next imply his thought <newline> then let his boundless soul new glories fire <newline> and to the great demosthenes aspire <newline> when round in throngs the listning people come <newline> tadmire what sprung in greece so slow at home <newline> raisd to this height your leisure hours engage <newline> in something just and worthy of the stage <newline> your choice of words from cicero derive <newline> and in your poems you design shoud live <newline> the joys of feasts and terrors of a war <newline> more pleasing those and these more frightful are <newline> when told by you than in their acting were <newline> and thus enrichd with such a golden store <newline> youre truly fit to be an orator. <newline> while i was wholly taken up with agamemnon i did not observe how <newline> ascyltos had given me the slip and as i continud my diligence a <newline> great crowd of scholars filld the portico to hear as it appeard <newline> afterwards an extemporary declamation of i know not whom that was <newline> discanting on what agamemnon had said while therefore they ridiculd <newline> his advice and condemnd the order of the whole i took an <newline> opportunity of getting from them and ran in quest of ascyltos but <newline> the hurry i was in with my ignorance where our inn lay so distracted <newline> me that what way soever i went i returnd by the same till tird in <newline> the pursuit and all in a sweat i met an old herbwoman and i <newline> beseech ye mother quoth i do you know whereabouts i dwell <newline> pleasd with the simplicity of such a homebred jest why should i <newline> not answerd she and getting on her feet went on before me i <newline> thought her no less than a witch but having led me into a bye lane <newline> she threw off her pyebald patchtmantle and here quoth she you <newline> cant want a lodging. <newline>  <newline> while i was denying i knew the house i observd a company of beaux <newline> reading the bills oer the cells on which was inscribd the name of <newline> the whore and her price and others of the same function naked <newline> scuttling it here and there as if they would not yet would be seen <newline> when too late i found my self in a bawdyhouse cursing the jade that <newline> had trapand me thither i coverd my head and was just making off <newline> through the midst of them when in the very entry ascyltos met me but <newline> as tird as my self and in a manner dead youd have sworn the same <newline> old woman brought him. i could not forbear laughing but having <newline> saluted each other i askd what business he had in so scandalous a <newline> place he wipd his face and if you knew said he what has <newline> happened to me as what quoth i <newline>  <newline> he faintly replyd when i had rovd the whole city without finding <newline> where i had left the inn the master of this house came up to me and <newline> kindly proferd to be my guide so through many a cross lane and blind <newline> turning having brought me to this house he drew his weapon and prest <newline> for a closer ingagement. in this affliction the whore of the cell <newline> also demanded garnishmoney and he laid such hands on me that had i <newline> not been too strong for him i had gone by the worst of it. <newline>  <newline> while ascyltos was telling his tale in come the same fellow with a <newline> woman none of the least agreeable and looking upon ascyltos <newline> entreated him to walk in and fear nothing for if he would not be <newline> passive he might be active the woman on the other hand pressd me to <newline> go in with her. we followd therefore and being led among those <newline> bills we saw many of both sexes at work in the cells so much every <newline> of them seemd to have taken a provocative <newline>  <newline> nor were we sooner discoverd than they woud have been at us with the <newline> like impudence and in a trice one of them his coat tuckd under his <newline> girdle laid hold on ascyltos and threw him athwart a couch i <newline> presently ran to help the undermost and putting our strengths <newline> together we made nothing of the troublesome fool. ascyltos went off <newline> and flying left me exposd to the fury but thanks to my strength i <newline> got off without hurt <newline>  <newline> i had almost traverst the city round when through the dusk i saw gito <newline> on the beggarsbench of our inn i made up to him and going in askd <newline> him what ascyltos had got us for dinner the boy sitting down on the <newline> bed began to wipe the tears that stood in his eyes i was much <newline> concernd at it and askd him the occasion he was slow in his <newline> answer and seemd unwilling but mixing threats with my intreaties <newline> twas that brother or comrogue of yours said he that coming ere <newline> while into our lodging woud have been at me and put hard for it <newline> when i cryd out he drew his sword and if thou art a lucreece <newline> said he thou hast met a tarquin. <newline>  <newline> i heard him and shaking my fist at ascyltos what saist thou said <newline> i thou catamite whose very breath is tainted <newline>  <newline> he dissembled at first a great trembling but presently throwing my <newline> arms aside in a higher voice cryd out must you be prating thou <newline> ribaldrous cutthroat whom condemnd for murdring thine host nothing <newline> but the fall of the stage could have savd you make a noise thou <newline> nightpad who when at thy best hadst never to do with any woman but a <newline> bawd on what account think ye was i the same to you in the aviary <newline> that the boy here now is <newline>  <newline> and who but you interrupted i gave me that slip in the portico <newline> why what my man of gotham continud he must i have done when i <newline> was dying for hunger hear sentence forsooth that is the ratling of <newline> broken glasses and the expounding of dreams so help me hercules as <newline> thou art the greater rogue of the two who to get a meals meat wert <newline> not ashamd to commend an insipid rhimer. when at last having <newline> turnd the humour from scolding to laughing we began to talk soberly <newline>  <newline> but the late injury still sticking in my stomach ascyltos said i <newline> i find we shall never agree together therefore lets divide the <newline> common stock and each of us set up for himself thourt a piece of a <newline> scholar and ill be no hindrance to thee but think of some other <newline> way for otherwise we shall run into a thousand mischiefs and become <newline> towntalk. <newline>  <newline> ascyltos was not against it and since we have promisd said he <newline> as scholars to sup together lets husband the night too and <newline> tomorrow ill get me a new lodging and some comrade or other. <newline>  <newline> tis irksome said i to defer what we like the itch of the flesh <newline> occasiond this hasty parting tho i had been a long time willing to <newline> shake off so troublesome an observer of my actions that i might renew <newline> my old intrigue with my gito <newline>  <newline> ascyltos taking it as an affront without answering went off in a <newline> heat i was too well acquainted with his subtle nature and the <newline> violence of his love not to fear the effects of so suddain a breach <newline> and therefore made after him both to observe his designs and prevent <newline> them but losing sight of him was a long time in pursuit to no <newline> purpose <newline>  <newline> when i had searchd the whole town i returnd to my lodging where <newline> the ceremony of kisses ended i got my boy to a closer hug and <newline> enjoying my wishes thought myself happy even to envy nor had i done <newline> when ascyltos stole to the door and springing the bolt found us at <newline> leapfrog upon which clapping his hands he fell a laughing and <newline> turning me out of the saddle what said he most reverend <newline> gentleman what were you doing my brother sterling not content <newline> with words only but untying the thong that bound his wallet he gave <newline> me a warning and with other reproaches as you like this so be for <newline> parting again. <newline>  <newline> the unexpectedness of the thing made me take no notice of it but <newline> politickly turn it off with a laugh for otherwise i must have been at <newline> loggarheads with my rival whereas sweetening him with a counterfeit <newline> mirth i brought him also to laugh for company and you encolpius <newline> began he are so wrapt in pleasures you little consider how short <newline> our money grows and what we have left will turn to no account <newline> theres nothing to be got in town this summertime we shall have <newline> better luck in the country lets visit our friends. <newline>  <newline> necessity made me approve his advice as well as conceal the smart of <newline> his lash so loading gito with our baggage we left the city and went <newline> to the house of one lycurgus a roman knight who because ascyltos <newline> had formerly been his pathick entertaind us handsomly and the <newline> company we met there made our diversions the pleasanter for first <newline> there was tryphna a very beautiful woman that had come with one <newline> lycas the owner of a ship and of a small seat that lay next the <newline> sea <newline>  <newline> the delight we receivd in this place was more than can be exprest <newline> tho lycurguss table was thrifty enough the first thing was every <newline> one to chuse his playmate the fair tryphna pleasd me and <newline> readily inclind to me but i had scarce given her the courtesie of <newline> the house when lycas storming to have his old amour slockt from him <newline> accusd me at first of underdealing but soon from a rival addressing <newline> himself as a lover he pleasantly told me i must repair his damages <newline> and plyed me hotly but tryphna having my heart i could not lend <newline> him an ear. the refusal set him the sharper he followd me <newline> whereever i went and getting into my chamber at night when entreaty <newline> did no good he fell to downright violence but i raisd such an <newline> outcry that i wakd the whole house and by the help of lycurgus got <newline> rid of him for that bout <newline>  <newline> at length perceiving lycurguss house was not for his purpose he <newline> would have persuaded me to his own but i rejecting the proffer he <newline> made use of tryphnas authority and she the rather persuaded me <newline> to yield to him because she was in hopes of living more at liberty <newline> there. i followd therefore whither my love led me but lycurgus <newline> having renewd his old concern with ascyltos woud not suffer him to <newline> depart at last we agreed that he shoud stay with lycurgus and we <newline> go with lycas over and beside which it was concluded that every of <newline> us as opportunity offerd should pilfer what he could for the common <newline> stock <newline>  <newline> lycas was overjoyd at my consent and so hastend our departure <newline> that taking leave of our friends we arrivd at his house the same <newline> day. but in our passage he so orderd the matter that he sate next <newline> me and tryphna next gito which he purposely contrivd to show <newline> the notorious lightness of that woman nor was he mistaken in her for <newline> she presently grew hot upon the boy i was quickly jealous and lycas <newline> so exactly remarkd it to me that he soon confirmd my suspicion of <newline> her. on this i began to be easier to him which made him all joy as <newline> being assurd the unworthiness of my new mistress woud beget my <newline> contempt of her and resenting her slight i shoud receive him with <newline> the better will <newline>  <newline> so stood the matter while we were at lycass tryphna was <newline> desperately in love with gito gito again as wholly devoted to her i <newline> card least for the sight of either of them and lycas studying to <newline> please me found me every day some new diversion in all which also <newline> his wife doris a fine woman strove to exceed him and that so gayly <newline> that she presently thrust tryphna from my heart i gave her the <newline> wink and she returnd her consent by as wanton a twinckle so that <newline> this dumb rhetorick going before the tongue secretly conveyd each <newline> others mind <newline>  <newline> i knew lycas was jealous which kept me tonguetyd so long and the <newline> love he bore his wife made him discover to her his inclination to me <newline> but the first opportunity we had of talking together she related to <newline> me what she had learnd from him and i frankly confessd it but <newline> withal told her how absolutely averse i had ever been tot well <newline> then quoth the discreet woman we must try our wits according to <newline> his own opinion the permission was ones and the possession <newline> anothers. <newline>  <newline> by this time gito had been worn off his legs and was gathering new <newline> strength when tryphna came back to me but disappointed of her <newline> expectations her love turnd to a downright fury and all on fire <newline> with following me to no purpose got into my intrigue both with lycas <newline> and his wife she made no account of his gamesomeness with me as well <newline> knowing it woud hinder no grist to her mill but for doris she never <newline> left till she had found out our private amours and gave a hint of it <newline> to lycas whose jealousie having got the upper hand of his love ran <newline> all to revenge but doris advertisd by tryphnas woman to <newline> divert the storm forbore any such meetings <newline>  <newline> as soon as i perceivd it having cursd the treachery of tryphna <newline> and the ingratitude of lycas i began to make off and fortune <newline> favourd me for a ship consecrated to the goddess isis laden with <newline> rich spoils had the day before run upon the rocks <newline>  <newline> gito and i laid our heads together and he was as willing as my self <newline> to be gone for tryphna having drawn him dry began now not to be <newline> so fond of him. early the next morning therefore we marchd to <newline> seaward where with the less difficulty we got on board the ship <newline> because we were no strangers to lycass servants then in wait upon <newline> her they still honouring us with their company it was not a time to <newline> filch any thing but leaving gito with them i took an opportunity of <newline> getting into the stern where the image of isis stood and stripd her <newline> of a rich mantle and silver taber lifting other good booty out of <newline> the masters cabin i stole down by a rope unseen by any but gito <newline> who also gave them the slip and sculkd after me <newline>  <newline> as soon as i saw him i shewd him the purchase and both of us <newline> resolvd to make what haste we could to ascyltos but lycurguss house <newline> was not to be reachd the same day when we came to ascyltos we shewd <newline> him the prize and told him in short the manner of getting it and how <newline> we were made a meer maygame of love he advisd us to prepossess <newline> lycurgus with our case and make him our friend ere the others could <newline> see him and withal boldly assert it that the trick lycas would have <newline> served them was the only cause why they stole away so hastily which <newline> when lycurgus came to understand he swore he would at all times <newline> protect us against our enemies <newline>  <newline> our fight was unknown till tryphna and doris were got out of bed <newline> for we daily attended their levy and waited on them while they were <newline> dressing but when contrary to custom they found us missing lycas <newline> tent after us and especially to the seaside for he had heard we <newline> made that way but not a word of the pillage for the ship lay <newline> somewhat to seaward and the master had not yet returnd on board <newline>  <newline> but at last it being taken for granted we had run away and lycas <newline> becoming uneasie for want of us fell desperately foul on his wife <newline> whom he supposd to be the cause of our departure ill take no notice <newline> of what words and blows past between them i know not every <newline> particular ill only say tryphna the mother of mischief had <newline> put lycas in the head that it might so be we had taken sanctuary at <newline> lycurguss where she persuaded him to go in quest of the runnagates <newline> and promisd to bear him company that she might confound our <newline> impudence with just reproaches <newline>  <newline> the next day they accordingly set forward and came to his house but <newline> we were out of the way for lycurgus was gone to a festival in honour <newline> of hercules held at a neighbouring village and had taken us with <newline> him of which when the others were informd they made what haste they <newline> could to us and met us in the portico of the temple. the sight of <newline> them very much disordered us lycas eagerly complained of our flight <newline> to lycurgus but was received with such a bended brow and so haughty <newline> a look that i grew valiant upont and with an open throat chargd <newline> him with his beastly attempts upon me as well at lycurguss as in his <newline> own house and tryphna endeavouring to stop my mouth had her <newline> share with him for i set out her harlotry to the mob who were got <newline> about us to hear the scolding and as a proof of what i said i shewd <newline> them poor sapless gito and my self also whom that itch of the whore <newline> had even brought to our graves <newline>  <newline> the shout of the mob put our enemies so out of countenance that they <newline> went off heavily but contriving a revenge and therefore observing <newline> how we had put upon lycurgus they went back to expect him at his <newline> house and set him right again. the solemnity ending later than was <newline> expected we could not reach lycurguss that night and therefore he <newline> brought us to a halfway house but left us asleep next morning and <newline> went home to despatch some business where he found lycas and <newline> tryphna waiting for him who so ordered the matter with him that <newline> they brought him to secure us. lycurgus naturally barbarous and <newline> faithless began to contrive which way to betray us and sent lycas to <newline> get some help whilst he secured us in the village <newline>  <newline> thither he came ard at his first entry treated us as lycas had done <newline> after which wringing his hands together he upbraided us with the lye <newline> we had made of lycas and taking ascyltos from us lockd us up in the <newline> room where we were without so much as hearing him speak in our <newline> defence but carrying him to his house set a guard upon us till <newline> himself should return <newline>  <newline> on the road ascyltos did what he could to mollifie lycurgus but <newline> neither entreaties nor love nor tears doing any good on him it came <newline> into our comerades head to set us at liberty and being all on fire at <newline> lycurguss restiness refusd to bed with him that night and by that <newline> means the more easily put in execution what he had been thinking on <newline>  <newline> the family was in their dead sleep when ascyltos took our fardels on <newline> his shoulders and getting through a breach in the wall which he had <newline> formerly taken notice of came to the village by break of day and <newline> meeting no one to stop him boldly enterd it and came up to our <newline> chamber which the guard that was upon us took care to secure but <newline> the bar being of wood he easily wrenched it with an iron crow and <newline> wakend us for we snord in spight of fortune <newline>  <newline> our guard had so overwatched themselves that they were falln into a <newline> dead sleep and we only wakd at the crack. to be short ascyltos <newline> came in and briefly told us what he had done for our sakes on this we <newline> got up and as we were rigging our selves it came into my head to <newline> kill the guard and rifle the village i told ascyltos my mind. he <newline> liked the rifling well enough but gave us a wishd delivery without <newline> blood for being acquainted with every corner of the house he pickd <newline> the lock of an innerroom where the movables lay and bringing us into <newline> it we lifted what was of most value and got off while it was yet <newline> early in the morning avoiding the common road and not resting till <newline> we thought our selves out of danger <newline>  <newline> then ascyltos having got heart again began to amplifie the delight he <newline> took in having pillagd lycurgus of whose miserableness he not <newline> without cause complaind for he neither paid him for his nights <newline> service nor kept a table that had either meat or drink ont being <newline> such a sordid pinchpeny that notwithstanding his infinite wealth <newline> he denyd himself the common necessaries of life <newline>  <newline> unhappy tantalus amidst the flood <newline> where floating apple on the surface rolld <newline> ever pursud them with a longing eye <newline> yet could not thurst nor hunger satisfie <newline> such is the misers fate who midst his store <newline> fearing to use is miserably poor <newline>  <newline> ascyltos would have been for naples the same day had i not told him <newline> how imprudent it was to take up there where forasmuch as could be <newline> conjecturd we were most likely to be sought after and therefore <newline> said i lets keep out of the way for the present and since we have <newline> enough to keep us from want stroul it about till the heat be over. <newline> the advice was approvd and we set forward for a pleasant <newline> countrytown where we were sure to meet some of our acquaintance that <newline> were taking the benefit of the season but we were scarce got half <newline> way when a shower of rain emptying it self upon us like buckets <newline> forcd us into the next village where entring the inn we saw a great <newline> many others that had also struck in to avoid the storm. the throng <newline> kept us from being taken notice of and gave us the opportunity of <newline> prying here and there what we might filch in a crowd when ascyltos <newline> unheeded of any one took a purse from the ground in which he found <newline> several pieces of gold we leapd for joy at so fortunate a beginning <newline> but fearing lest some or other might seek after it we slunk out at a <newline> backdoor where we saw a groom saddling his horses but as having <newline> forgotten somewhat he run into the house leaving behind him an <newline> embroiderd mantle maild to one of the saddles in his absence i cut <newline> the straps and under the covert of some outsheds we made off with it <newline> to a neighbouring forest. being more out of danger among the thickets <newline> we cast about where we should hide the gold that we might not be <newline> either chargd with the felony or robbd of it our selves at last we <newline> concluded to sow it in the lining of an old patcht coat which i threw <newline> over my shoulders and entrusted the care of the mantle to ascyltos in <newline> design to get to the city by crossways but as we were going out we <newline> heard somewhat on our left hand to this purpose they shall not <newline> escape us they came into the wood lets separate ourselves and beat <newline> about that we may the better discover and take them. this put us <newline> into such a fright that ascyltos and gito fled through briars and <newline> brambles to the cityward but i turnd back again in such a hurry <newline> that without perceiving it the precious coat dropd from my shoulders <newline> at last being quite tird and not able to go any further i laid me <newline> down under the shelter of a tree where i first missd the coat then <newline> grief restord my strength and up i got again to try if i could <newline> recover the treasure i ran hither and thither and every where but to <newline> no purpose but spent and wasted between toil and heaviness i got <newline> into a thicket where having tarried four hours and half dead with <newline> the horror of the place i sought the way out but going forward a <newline> countryman came in sight of me then i had need of all my confidence <newline> nor did it fail me i went up roundly to him and making my moan how i <newline> had lost my self in the wood desird him tell me the was to the city <newline> he pittying my figure for i was as pale as death and all bemird <newline> askd me if i had seen any one in the wood i answerd not a <newline> soulon which he courteously brought me into the highway where he <newline> met two of his friends who told him they had traversd the wood <newline> thro and thro but had light upon nothing but a coat which they <newline> shewd him <newline>  <newline> it may easily be believed i had not the courage to challenge it tho <newline> i knew well enough what the value of it was this struck me more than <newline> all the rest however bewailing my treasure the countryman not <newline> heeding me and feebleness growing upon me i slackend my pace and <newline> joggd on slower than ordinarily <newline>  <newline> it was longer ere i reachd the city than i thought of but coming to <newline> the inn i found ascyltos half dead and stretcht on a straw pallet <newline> and fell on another my self not able to utter a word he missing the <newline> coat was in a great disorder and hastily demanded of me what was <newline> become of it i on the other hand scarce able to draw my breath <newline> resolvd him by my languishing eyes what my tongue would not give me <newline> leave to speak at length recovering by little and little i plainly <newline> told him the ill luck i had met with but he thought i jested and <newline> tho the tears in my eyes might have been as full evidence to him as <newline> an oath he yet questioned the truth of what i said and would not <newline> believe but i had a mind to cheat him. during this gito stood as <newline> troubled as my self and the boys sadness increased mine but the <newline> fresh suit that was after us distracted me most. i opened the whole <newline> to ascyltos who seemd little concernd at it as having luckily got <newline> off for the present and withal assurd himself that we were past <newline> danger in that we were neither known nor seen by any one however <newline> it was thought fit to pretend a sickness that we might have the <newline> better pretext to keep where we were but our monies falling shorter <newline> than we thought of and necessity enforcing us we found it high time <newline> to sell some of our pillage <newline>  <newline> it was almost dark when going into the brokers market we saw <newline> abundance of things to be bought and sold of no extraordinary value <newline> tis true yet such whose nightwalking trade the dusk of the evening <newline> might easily conceal. we also had the mantle with us and taking the <newline> opportunity of a blind corner fell a shaking the skirt of it to try <newline> if so glittering a shew would bring us a purchaser nor had we been <newline> long there ere a certain countryman whom i thought i had seen <newline> before came up to us with a hussye that followd him and began to <newline> consider the mantle more narrowly as on rhe other side did ascyltos <newline> our country chapmans shoulders which presently startled him and <newline> struck him dumb nor could my self behold em without being concernd <newline> at it for he seemed to me to be the same fellow that had found the <newline> coat in the wood as in truth he was but ascyltos doubting whether he <newline> might trust his eyes or not and that he might not do any thing <newline> rashly first came nearer to him as a buyer and taking the coat from <newline> his shoulders began to cheapen and turn it more carefully. o the <newline> wonderful vagaries of fortune for the countryman had not so much as <newline> examined a seam of it but carelessly exposed it as beggarsbooty <newline>  <newline> ascyltos seeing the coat unript and the person of the seller <newline> contemptible took me aside from the crowd and dont you see <newline> brother said he the treasure i made such moan about is returned <newline> thats the coat with the gold int all safe and untoucht what <newline> therefore do we do or what course shall we take to get our own <newline> again <newline>  <newline> i now comforted not so much that i had seen the booty but had <newline> cleard my self of the suspicion that lay upon me was by no means for <newline> going about the bush but downright bringing an action against him <newline> that if the fellow would not give up the coat to the right owner we <newline> might recover it by law <newline>  <newline> laws bear the name but money has the power <newline> the cause is bad when eer the clients poor <newline> those strickt livd men that seem above our world <newline> are oft too modest to resist our gold <newline> so judgment like our other wares is sold <newline> and the grave knight that nods upon the laws <newline> wakd by a fee hems and approves the cause <newline>  <newline> ascyltos on the other side afraid of the law who said he knows <newline> us in this place or will give any credit to what we say i am clear <newline> for buying it tho we know it to be our own and rather recover the <newline> treasure with a little money than embroil our selves in an uncertain <newline> suit but we had not above a couple of groats ready money and that <newline> we designd should buy us somewhat to eat. least therefore the coat <newline> should be gone in the mean time we agreed rather than fail to sell <newline> the mantle at a lower price that the advantage we got by the one <newline> might make what we lost by the other more easie <newline>  <newline> as soon therefore as we had spread open the mantle the woman that <newline> stood muffled by the countryman having pryingly taken notice of some <newline> tokens about it forceably laid both hands ont and setting up her <newline> throat cryed out thieves thieves <newline>  <newline> we on the tother part being disordered at it lest yet he might seem <newline> to do nothing got hold of the totterd coat and as spitefully <newline> roard they had robbd us of it but our case was in no wise like <newline> theirs and the rabble that came in to the outcry ridiculd as they <newline> were wont the weaker side in that the others laid claim to so rich a <newline> mantle and we to a ragged coat scarce worth a good patch. at this <newline> ascyltos could hardly keep his countenance but the noise being over <newline> we see said he how every one likes his own best give us our coat <newline> and let them take the mantle <newline>  <newline> the countryman and the woman likd the exchange well enough but a <newline> sort of pettyfoggers most of whose business was such night practice <newline> having a mind to get the mantle themselves as importunately required <newline> that both mantle and coat should be left in their hands and the judge <newline> would hear their complaints on the morrow for it was not the things <newline> alone that seemd to be in dispute but quite another matter to be <newline> enquird into to wit a strong suspicion of robbery on both sides <newline>  <newline> at last it was agreed to put both into some indifferent hand till the <newline> right were determind when presently one i know not who with a bald <newline> pate and a face full of pimples he had been formerly a kind of <newline> solicitor steps out of the rout and laying hold on the mantle said <newline> hed be security it should be forthcoming the next day when in truth <newline> he intended nothing more but that having gotten it into hucksters <newline> hands it might be smugled among them as believing we would never <newline> come to own it for fear of being taken up for it for our part we <newline> were as willing as he and an accident befriended both of us for the <newline> countryman thinking scorn of it that we demanded to have the patcht <newline> coat given us threw it at ascyltoss head and discharging us of <newline> everything but the mantle required that to be securd as the only <newline> cause of the dispute. having therefore recovered as we thought our <newline> treasure we made all the haste we could to the inn and having shut <newline> the door upon us made our selves merry as well with the judgment of <newline> the rabble as of our detractors who with so much circumspection had <newline> restord us our money <newline>  <newline> while we were ripping the coat and taking out the gold we overheard <newline> somebody asking mine host what kind of people those were that had <newline> just now come in and being startled at it i went down to see what <newline> was the matter and understood that a city serjeant who according to <newline> the duty of his office took an account of all strangers and had seen <newline> a couple come into the inn whose names he had not yet registered and <newline> therefore inquired of what country they were and what way of living <newline> they had <newline>  <newline> but mine host gave me such a blind account of it that i began to <newline> suspect we were not safe there whereupon for fear of being taken up <newline> we thought fit to go off for the present and not come back again till <newline> it was in the night but leave the care of our supper to gito <newline>  <newline> we had resolvd to keep out of the broad streets and accordingly took <newline> our walk thro that quarter of the city where we were likely to meet <newline> least company when in a narrow winding lane that had not passage <newline> thro we saw somewhat before us two comely matronlike women and <newline> followed them at a distance to a chappel which they entred whence we <newline> heard an odd humming kind of noise as if it came from the hollow of a <newline> cave curiosity also made us go in after them where we saw a number <newline> of women as mad as they had been sacrificing to bacchus and each of <newline> them an amulet the ensign of priapus in her hand. more than that we <newline> could not get to see for they no sooner perceived us than they set <newline> up such a shout that the roof of the temple shook agen and withal <newline> endeavoured to lay hands on us but we scamperd and made what haste <newline> we could to the inn <newline>  <newline> nor had we sooner stuffd our selves with the supper gito had got for <newline> us when a more than ordinary bounce at the door put us into another <newline> fright and when we pale as death askd who was there twas <newline> answerd open the door and youll see while we were yet talking <newline> the bolt dropd off and the door flew open on which a woman with <newline> her head muffld came in upon us but the same who a little before had <newline> stood by the countryman in the market and what said she do you <newline> think to put a trick upon me i am quartillas maid whose sacred <newline> recess you so lately disturbd she is at the inngate and desires to <newline> speak with ye not that she either taxes your inadvertency or has a <newline> mind to so resent it but rather wonders what god brought such civil <newline> gentlemen into her quarters. <newline>  <newline> we were silent as yet and gave her the hearing but inclind to <newline> neither part of what she had said when in came quartilla herself <newline> attended with a young girl and sitting down by me fell a weeping <newline> nor here also did we offer a word but stood expecting what those <newline> tears at command meant. at last when the showre had emptied it self <newline> she disdainfully turnd up her hood and clinching her fingers <newline> together till the joints were ready to crack what impudence said <newline> she is this or where learnt ye those shamms and that slight of <newline> hand ye have so lately been beholding to by my faith young men i <newline> am sorry for ye for no one beheld what was unlawful for him to see <newline> and went off unpunisht and verily our part of the town has so many <newline> deities youll sooner find a god than a man int and that you may <newline> not think i came hither to be revenged on ye i am more concernd for <newline> your youth than the injury ye have done me for unawares as i yet <newline> think ye have committed an unexpiable abomination <newline>  <newline> for my part it troubled me all night and threw me into such a <newline> shaking that i was afraid i had gotten a tertian on which i took <newline> somewhat to have made me sleep but the god appeared to me and <newline> commanded me to rise and find ye out as the likeliest way to take off <newline> the violence of the fit. but i am not so much in pain for a remedy <newline> as that a greater anguish strikes me to the heart and will <newline> undoubtedly make an end of me for fear in one of your youthful <newline> frolicks you should disclose what you saw in priapuss chappel and <newline> utter the counsels of the gods among the people. low as your knees i <newline> therefore lift my hands tye that ye neither make sport of our <newline> nightworship nor dishonour the mysteries of so many years which <newline> tis not every one even among our selves that knows. <newline>  <newline> after this she fell a crying again and with many a pittiful groan <newline> fell flat on my bed when i at the same time between pity and fear <newline> bid her take courage and assure her self of both for that we would <newline> neither divulge those holy mysteries nor if the god had prescribed <newline> her any other remedy fot her ague be wanting our selves to assist <newline> providence even with our own hazard <newline>  <newline> at this promise of mine becoming more chearful she fell a kissing me <newline> thick and threefold and turning the humour of tears into laughing <newline> she combd up some hair that hung over my face with her fingers and <newline> i come to a truce with ye said she and discharge ye of the <newline> process i intended against you but if ye shoud refuse me the <newline> medicine i entreat of ye for the ague i have fellows enough will be <newline> ready by to morrow that shall both vindicate my reputation and <newline> revenge the affront ye put upon me <newline>  <newline> contempts dishonorable and the giver rude <newline> tadvise the doctor speaks the patient proud <newline> but l am mistress of my self so far <newline> i can pay scorn with scorn without a war <newline> the wise revenge is to neglect the ill <newline> theyre not the only conquerours that kill. <newline>  <newline> then clapping her hands together she turnd off to so violent a <newline> laughter that made us apprehensive of some design against us the <newline> same also did the woman that came in first and the girl that came <newline> with her but so mimically that seeing no reason for so sudden a <newline> change we one while stard on one another and otherwhile on the <newline> woman <newline>  <newline> at length quoth quartilla i have commanded that no flesh alive be <newline> suffered to come into this inn to day that i may receive from you the <newline> medicine for the ague without interruption. <newline>  <newline> at what time ascyltos was a little amazd and i so chilld that i had <newline> not power to utter a word but the company gave me heart not to expect <newline> worse for they were but three women and if they had any design must <newline> yet be too weak to effect it against us who if we had nothing more of <newline> man about us had yet that figure to befriend us we were all girt up <newline> for the purpose and i had so contrivd the couples that if it must <newline> come to a rancounter i was to make my part good with quartilla <newline> ascyltos with her woman and gito the girl <newline>  <newline> while i was thus casting the matter in my head quartilla came up to <newline> me to cure me of the ague but finding her self disappointed flew <newline> off in a rage and returning in a little while told us there were <newline> certain persons unknown had a design upon us and therefore commanded <newline> to remove us into a noble palace <newline>  <newline> here all our courage faild us and nothing but certain death seemd <newline> to appear before us <newline>  <newline> then i began if madam you design to be more severe with us be yet <newline> so kind as to dispatch it quickly for whateer our offence be it is <newline> not so hainous that we ought to be rackd to death for it upon which <newline> her woman whose name was psyche spread a coverlet on the floor <newline> sollicitavit inguina mea mille iam mortibus frigida. ascyltos muffled <newline> his head in his coat as having had a hint given him how dangerous it <newline> was to take notice of what did not concern him. in the mean time <newline> psyche took off her garters and with one of them bound my feet and <newline> with the other my hands <newline>  <newline> thus fetterd as i lay this madam said i is not the way to rid <newline> you of your ague. i grant it answerd psyche but i have a dose <newline> at hand will infallibly do it and therefore brought me a lusty bowl <newline> of satyricon a lovepotion and so merrily ran over the wonderful <newline> effects of it that i had wellnigh suckd it all off but because <newline> ascyltos had slighted her courtship she finding his back towards her <newline> threw the bottom of it on him <newline>  <newline> ascyltos perceiving the chat was at an end am not i worthy said <newline> he to get a sup and psyche fearing my laughter might discover <newline> her clapped her hands and told him youngman i made you an offer <newline> of it but your friend here has drunk it all out. <newline>  <newline> is it so quoth quartilla smiling very agreeably and has <newline> ercolpius guggd it all down at last also even gito laught for <newline> company at what time the young wench flung her arms about his neck <newline> and meeting no resistance half smotherd him with kisses <newline>  <newline> we would have cryd out but there was no one near to help us and as <newline> i was offering to bid em keep the peace psyche fell a nipping and <newline> pricking me with her bodkin on the other side also the young wench <newline> half stifled ascyltos with a dishclout she had rubbd in the bowl <newline>  <newline> lastly came leaping upon us a burdash in a rough mantle stuck with <newline> myrtle girt about him and one while almost ground our hipps to <newline> powder with his bobbing at us and other while slobberd us with his <newline> nasty kisses till quartilla holding her staff of office in her hand <newline> dischargd us of the service but not without having first taken an <newline> oath of us that so dreadful a secret should go no further than our <newline> selves. then came in a company of wrestlers and rubbd us over with <newline> the yolk of an egg beaten to oil when being somewhat refreshd we <newline> put on our right gowns and were led into the next room that had <newline> three beds in it all well appointed and the rest of the <newline> entertainment as splendidly set out. the word was given and we sate <newline> down when having whet our appetites with an excellent antipast we <newline> swilld our selves with the choicest of wine nor was it long eer we <newline> fell a nodding. it is so quoth quartilla can ye sleep when ye <newline> know it is the vigil to priapus at what time ascyltos snord so <newline> soundly that psyche not yet forgeting the disapointment he gave <newline> her all besooted his face and scord down his shoulders with a burnt <newline> sticks end <newline>  <newline> plagud with these mischiefs i hardly got the least wink of sleep <newline> nor was the whole family whether within doors or without in a much <newline> better condition some lay up and down at our feet others had run <newline> their heads against the walls and others lay dead asleep cross the <newline> threshold the lamps also having drunk up their oil gave a thin and <newline> last blaze <newline>  <newline> at this instant got in a couple of pilfering rogues to have stollen <newline> our wine but while they fell a scuffling among some silver vessels <newline> that stood upon the table they broke the earthen pot that held the <newline> wine and overthrew the table with the plate on it and at the same <newline> time also a cup falling off the shelf on psyches bed broke her head <newline> as she lay fast asleep on which he cryd out and therewith <newline> discovered the thieves and wakd some of the drunkards the thieves <newline> on the other hand finding themselves in a pound threw themselves on <newline> one of the beds as some of the guests and fell a snoring like the <newline> rest. the usher of the hall being by this time got awake put some <newline> more oil in the dying lamps and the boys having rubbd their eyes <newline> returnd to their charge when in came a woman that playd on the <newline> harp and ratling its strings rousd all the rest on which the <newline> banquet was renewd and quartilla gave the word to go on where we <newline> left that is drinking the she harper also added not a little to our <newline> midnight revel <newline>  <newline> at last bolted in a shameless rascal one of no grace either in words <newline> or gesture and truly worthy of the house where he was he also set up <newline> his voice till apishly composing himself as if he intended somewhat <newline> to the company he mouthd out these verses <newline>  <newline> o yes now tumblers with your wanton tricks <newline> make haste move your legs quick make the ground drum <newline> with wanton arms soft thighs and active hips <newline> the old the tender and the sweetly young <newline>  <newline> consumptis versibus suis immundissimo me basio conspuit. mox et super <newline> lectum venit atque omni vi detexit recusantem. super inguina mea diu <newline> multumque frustea moluit. profluebant per frontem sudantem acaciae <newline> rivi et inter rugas malarum tantum erat cretae ut putares detectum <newline> parictum nimbo laborare. non tenui ego diutius lacrimas sed ad <newline> ultiman perductus tristitiam. quaeso inquam domina certe <newline> embasicoetan iusseras dari. complosit illa tenerius manus et o <newline> inquit homincm acutum atque urbanitatis vernaculae fontem. quid tu <newline> non intellexeras cinaedum embasicoetan vocari deinde ut <newline> contubernali meo melius succederet per fidem inquam vestram <newline> ascyltos in hoc triclinio solus ferias aglt ita inquit quartilla <newline> et ascylto embasicoetas detur. ab hoc voce equum cinaedus mutavit <newline> transituque ad comitem meum facto clunibus eutn basiisque distrivit <newline> stabat inter haec giton et risu disolvebat ilia sua. itaque <newline> conspicata eum quartilla cuius esset puer diligentissima <newline> sciscitatione quaesivit. cum ego fratrem meum esse dixissem quare <newline> ergo inquit me non basiavit vocatumque ad se in osculum <newline> applicuit. mox manum etiam demisit in sinum et pertrectato vasculo <newline> tam rudi haec inquit belle cras in promulside libidinis nostrae <newline> militabit hodie enim post asellum diari non sumo. with that psyche <newline> came tittering to her and having whispered i know not what in her <newline> ear thou art in the right quoth quartilla twas well thought on <newline> and since we have so fine an opportunity why should not our pannychis <newline> lose her maidenhead and forthwith was brought in a pretty young <newline> girl that seemd not to be above seven years of age and was the same <newline> that first came into our room with quartilla all approvd it with a <newline> general clap ard next desiring it a wedding was struck up between <newline> the boy and her. for my part i stood amazd and assurd them that <newline> neither gito a bashful lad was able for the drudgery nor the girl <newline> of years to receive it. ita inquit quartilla minor eat ista quam <newline> ego fui quum primum virum passa sum iunonem meam iratam habeam si <newline> umquam me meminerim virginem fuisse. nam et infans cum paribus <newline> inclinata sum et subinde procedentibus annis maioribus me pueris <newline> applicui donec ad hanc aetatem perveni. hinc etiam puto proverbium <newline> natum illud ut dicatur posse taurum tollere qui vitulum sustulerit. <newline>  <newline> least therefore my comrade might run a greater hazard i got up to the <newline> wedding <newline>  <newline> and now psyche put a flamecolour veil on the girls head the pathick <newline> led before with a flamboe and a long train of drunken women fell a <newline> shouting and drest up the bridechamber quartilla all agog as the <newline> rest took hold of gito and draggd him in with her but truly the boy <newline> made no resistance nor seemd the girl frighted at the name of <newline> matrimony. when therefore they were lockt up we sat without before <newline> the threshold of the chamber and quartilla having waggishly slit a <newline> chink thro the door as wantonly laid an apes eye to it nor content <newline> with that pluckt me also to see that childs play and when we were <newline> not peeping would turn her lips to me and steal a kiss <newline>  <newline> the jades fulsomeness had so tird me that i began to devise which <newline> was to get off. i told ascyltos my mind and he was well pleased with <newline> it for he was a willing to get rid of his torment psyche nor was it <newline> hard to be done if gito had not been lockt up in the chamber for we <newline> were resolved to take him with us and not leave him the mercy of a <newline> bawdyhouse. while we were contriving how to effect it it so <newline> happened that pannychis fell out of bed and drew gito after her <newline> without any hurt though the girl got a small knock in the fall and <newline> therewith made such a cry that quartilla all in a fright ran <newline> headlong in and gave us the opportunity of getting off and taking <newline> the boy with us when without more ado we flew to our inn and <newline> getting to bed past the rest of the night without fear <newline>  <newline> but going out the next day whom should we meet but two of those <newline> fellows that robbd us of the mantle which ascyltos perceiving he <newline> briskly attackd one of them and having disarmd and desperately <newline> wounded him came in to my relief who was pressing upon the other <newline> but he behavd himself so well that he wounded us both altho but <newline> slightly and got off himself without so much as a scratch <newline>  <newline> and now came the third day that is the expectation of an <newline> entertainment at trimalchios where every one might speak what he <newline> would but having received some wounds we thought flight might be of <newline> more use to us than sitting still we got to our inn therefore as <newline> fast as we could and our wounds not being great cured them as we lay <newline> in bed with wine and oyl <newline>  <newline> but the rogue whom ascyltos had hewn down lay in the street and we <newline> were in fear of being discovered while therefore we were pensively <newline> considering which way to avoid the impending storm a servant of <newline> agamemnons interrupted our fears and do not ye know said he <newline> with whom we eat today trimalchio a trim finical humorist has a <newline> clock in his diningroom and one on purpose to let him know how many <newline> minutes of his life he had lost. we therefore drest our selves <newline> carefully and gito willingly taking upon him the part of a servant <newline> as he had hither to done we bade him put our things together and <newline> follow us to the bath <newline>  <newline> being in the mean time got ready we walkd we knew not where or <newline> rather having a mind to divert us struck into a tenniscourt where <newline> we saw an old baldpated fellow in a carnationcolourd coat playing <newline> at ball with a company of boys nor was it so much the boys tho it <newline> was worth our while that engaged us to be lookers on as the master of <newline> the house himself in pumps who altogether tossed the ball and never <newline> struck it after it once came to the ground but had a servant by him <newline> with a bag full of them ard enough for all that playd <newline>  <newline> we observed also some new things for in the gallery stood two <newline> eunuchs one of whom held a silver chamberpot the other counted the <newline> balls not those they kept tossing but such as fell to the ground <newline> while we admird the humour one menelaus came up to us and told us <newline> we were come where we must set up for the night and we had seen the <newline> beginning of our entertainment. as he was yet talking trimalchio <newline> snappd his fingers at which sign the eunuch held the chamberpot to <newline> him as he was playing then calling for water he dipped the tips of <newline> his fingers in it and dryd them on the boys head. twould be too <newline> long to recount every thing we went into the hothouse and having <newline> sweated a little into the cold bath and while trimalchio was <newline> anointed from head to foot with a liquid perfume and rubbd clean <newline> again not with linnen but with finest flannen his three chyrurgeons <newline> plyd the muscadine but brawling over their cups trimalchio said it <newline> was his turn to drink then wrapt in a scarlet mantle he was laid on <newline> a litter born by six servants with four lacqueys in rich liveries <newline> running before him and by his side a sedan in which was carried his <newline> darling a stale bleereyed catamite more illfavoured than his <newline> master trimalchio who at they went on kept close to his ear with a <newline> flagellet as if he had whispered him and made him musick all the way <newline> wondering we followed and with agamemnon came to the gate on <newline> which hung a tablet with this inscription <newline>  <newline> what ever servant goes forth without his masters command he shall <newline> receive an hundred stripes <newline>  <newline> in the porch stood the porter in a green livery girt about with a <newline> cherrycoloured girdle garbling of pease in a silver charger and <newline> over head hung a golden cage with a magpye in it which gave us an all <newline> hail as we entred but while i was gaping at these things i had like <newline> to have broken my neck backward for on the left hand not far from <newline> the porters lodge there was a great dog in a chain painted on the <newline> wall and over him written in capital letters beware the dog. my <newline> companions could not forbear laughing bur i recollecting my spirits <newline> pursued my design of going to the end of the wall it was the draught <newline> of a marketplace where slaves were bought and sold with bills over <newline> them there was also trimalchio with a white staff in his hand and <newline> minerva with a train after her entring rome then having learnt how to <newline> cast accompt he was made auditor all exquisitely painted with their <newline> proper titles and at the end of the gallery mercury lifting him by <newline> the chin and placing him on a judgmentseat. fortune stood by him <newline> with a cornucopia and the three fatal sisters winding a golden <newline> thread <newline>  <newline> i observed also in the same place a troop of lighthorsemen with <newline> their commander exercising them as also a large armory in one of the <newline> angles of which stood a shrine with the gods of the house in silver a <newline> marble statue of venus and a large golden box in which it was said <newline> he kept the first shavings of his beard. then asking the servant that <newline> had the charge of these things what pictures those were in the <newline> middle the iliads and the odysses said he and on the lefthand two <newline> spectacles of swordplaying. we could not bestow much time on it for <newline> by this time we were coming to the diningroom in the entry of which <newline> sate his steward taking every ones account but what i most admird <newline> were those bundles of rods with their axes that were fastned to the <newline> sides of the door and stood as it were on the brazen prow of a <newline> ship on which was written <newline>  <newline> to caius pompeius trimalchio of prtorian dignity cinnamus the <newline> steward <newline>  <newline> under the same title also hung a lamp of two lights from the roof of <newline> the room and two tablets on either side of the door of which one if <newline> i well remember had this inscription <newline>  <newline> the third and second of the kalends of january our patron caius eats <newline> abroad <newline>  <newline> on the other was represented the course of the moon and the seven <newline> stars and what days were lucky what unlucky with an embossd studd <newline> to distinguish the one from the other <newline>  <newline> full of this sensuality we were now entring the room where one of his <newline> boys set there for that purpose calld aloud to us advance <newline> orderly. nor is it to be doubted but we were somewhat concernd for <newline> fear of breaking the orders of the place. but while we were footing <newline> it accordingly a servant stript off his livery fell at our feet and <newline> besought us to save him a whipping for he said his fault was no great <newline> matter but that some cloaths of the stewards had been stolen from him <newline> in the bath and all of them not worth eighteenpence <newline>  <newline> we returned therefore in good order and finding the steward in the <newline> countinghouse telling some gold besought him to remit the servants <newline> punishment when putting on an haughty face it is not said he <newline> the loss of the thing troubles me but the negligence of a careless <newline> rascal. he has lost me the garments i sate at table in and which a <newline> client of mine presented me on my birthday no man can deny them to <newline> be right purple tho not double dye yet whatever it be i grant your <newline> request. <newline>  <newline> having receivd so great a favour as we were entring the diningroom <newline> the servant for whom we had been suitors met us and kissing us who <newline> stood wondring what the humour meant over and over gave us thanks for <newline> our civility and in short told us we should know by and by whom it <newline> was we had obligd the wine which our master keeps for his own <newline> drinking is the waiters kindness <newline>  <newline> at length we sate down when a bigger and sprucer sort of boys coming <newline> about us some of them poured snowwater on our heads and others <newline> pard the nails of our feet with a mighty dexterity and that not <newline> silently but singing as it were by the bye i resolved to try if the <newline> whole family sang and therefore called for drink which one of the <newline> boys a readily brought me with an odd kind of tune and the same did <newline> every one as you asked for any thing youd have taken it for a morris <newline> dancers hall not the table of a person of quality <newline>  <newline> then came a sumptuous antepast for we were all seated but only <newline> trimalchio for whom after a new fashion the chief place was <newline> reservd. besides that as a part of the entertainment there was set <newline> by us a large vessel of metheglin with a pannier in the one part of <newline> which were white olives in the other black two broad platters <newline> covered the vessel on the brims of which were engraven trimalchios <newline> name and the weight of the silver with little bridges soldered <newline> together and on them dormice strewd over with honey and poppy there <newline> were also pipinghot sausages on a silver gridiron and under that <newline> large damsons with the kernels of pomegranats <newline>  <newline> in this condition were we when trimalchio himself was waddled into the <newline> consort and being close bolsterd with neckcloaths and pillows to <newline> keep off the air we could not forbear laughing unawares for his bald <newline> pate peepd out of a scarlet mantle and over the load of cloaths he <newline> lay under there hung an embroidered towel with purple tassels and <newline> fringes dingle dangle about it he had also on the little finger of <newline> his left hand a large gilt ring and on the outmost joint of the <newline> finger next it one lesser which i took for all gold but at last it <newline> appeared to be jointed together with a kind of stars of steel. and <newline> that we might see these were not all his bravery he strippd his <newline> right arm on which he wore a golden bracelet and an ivory circle <newline> bound together with a glittering locket and a meddal at the end of it <newline> then picking his teeth with a silver pin i had not my friends <newline> said he any inclination to have come among you so soon but fearing <newline> my absence might make you wait too long i denyd myself my own <newline> satisfaction however suffer me to make an end of my game there <newline> followed him a boy with an inlaid table and christal dice and i took <newline> notice of one thing more pleasant than the rest for instead of black <newline> and white counters his were all silver and gold pieces of money <newline>  <newline> in the mean time while he was squandering his heap at play and we <newline> were yet picking a relish here and there a cupboard was brought in <newline> with a basket in which was a hen carved in wood her wings lying <newline> round and hollow as sitting on brood when presently the consort <newline> struck up and two servants fell a searching the straw under her and <newline> taking out some peahens eggs distributed them among the company at <newline> this trimalchio changing countenance i commanded my friends said <newline> he the hen to be set with peahens eggs and so help me hercules am <newline> afraid they may be half hatcht however well try if they are yet <newline> suppable. <newline>  <newline> the thing we received was a kind of shell of at least six pounds <newline> weight made of paste and moulded into the figure of an egg which we <newline> easily broke and for my part i was like to have thrown away my <newline> share for it seemed to me to have a chick in it till hearing an old <newline> guest of the tables saying it was some good bit or other i searched <newline> further into it and found a delicate fat wheatear in the middle of a <newline> wellpepperd yolk on this trimalchio stopped his play for a while <newline> and requiring the like for himself proclaimd if any of us would <newline> have any more metheglin he was at liberty to take it when of a <newline> sudden the musick gave the sign and the first course was scrabled <newline> away by a company of singers and dancers but in the rustle it <newline> happening that a dish fell on the door a boy took it up and <newline> trimalchio taking notice of it pluckd him by the ears and commanded <newline> him to throw it down again on which the groom of the chamber came <newline> with a broom and swept away the silver dish with whatsoever else had <newline> fallen from the table <newline>  <newline> when presently came in two longhaird blacks with small leather <newline> bottles such as with which they strew sand on the stage and gave us <newline> wine to wash our hands but no one offered us water. we all admiring <newline> the finicalness of the entertainment mars said he is a lover of <newline> justice and therefore let every one have a table to himself for <newline> having more elbowroom these nasty stinking boys will be less <newline> troublesome to us and thereupon large doubleeared vessels of glass <newline> close plaistered over were brought up with labels about their necks <newline> upon which was this inscription <newline>  <newline> opimian muscadine of an hundred years old <newline>  <newline> while we were reading the titles trimalchio clapped his hands and <newline> alas alas said he that wine should live longer than man wine <newline> is life and well try if it has held good ever since the consulship <newline> of lucius opimius or not. tis right opimian and therefore make <newline> ready i brought not out so good yesterday yet there were persons of <newline> better quality supd with me. <newline>  <newline> we drank and admired every thing when in came a servant with a silver <newline> puppet so jointed and put together that it turned every way and <newline> being more than once thrown upon the table cast it self into several <newline> figures on which trimalchio came out with his poetry <newline>  <newline> unhappy mortals on how fine a thread <newline> our lives depend how like this puppet man <newline> shall we alas be all when we are dead <newline> therefore lets live merrily while we can <newline>  <newline> the applause we gave him was followed with a service but respecting <newline> the place not so considerable as might have been expected however <newline> the novelty of the thing drew every mans eye upon it it was a large <newline> charger with the twelve signs round it upon every one of which the <newline> master cook had laid somewhat or other suitable to the sign. upon <newline> aries chickpease a pulse not unlike a rams head upon taurus a <newline> piece of beef upon gemini a pair of pendulums and kidneys upon <newline> cancer a coronet upon leo an african figg upon virgo a wellgrown <newline> boy upon libra a pair of scales in one of which was a tart in the <newline> other a custard upon scorpio a pilchard upon sagittary a greyhound <newline> upon capricorn a lobster upon aquarius a goose upon pisces two <newline> mullets and in the middle a plat of herbs cut out like a green turf <newline> and over them a honeycomb. during this a lesser black carryd about <newline> bread in a silver oven and with a hideous voice forced a bawdy song <newline> from a buffoon that stunk like assa ftida <newline>  <newline> when trimalchio perceived we lookd somewhat awkwardly on such course <newline> fare come come said he fall to and eat this is the custom of <newline> the place. <newline>  <newline> nor had he sooner said it than the fourth consort struck up at which <newline> the waiters fell a dancing and took off the upper part of the <newline> charger under which was a dish of crammd fowl and the hinder paps <newline> of a sow that had farrowed but a day before well powdered and the <newline> middle a hare stuck in with finns of fish in his side that he lookd <newline> like a flying horse and on the sides of the fish four little images <newline> that spouted a relishing sauce on some fish that lay near them all of <newline> them brought from the river euripus <newline>  <newline> we also seconded the shout begun by the family and fell merrily <newline> aboard this and trimalchio no less pleasd than our selves cryed <newline> cut at which the musick sounding again the carver humourd it and <newline> cut up the meat with such antick postures youd have thought him a <newline> carman fighting to an organ <newline>  <newline> nevertheless trimalchio in a lower note cryed out again cut i <newline> hearing the word so often repeated suspecting there might be some <newline> joke in it was not ashamed to ask him that sate next above me what <newline> it meant and he that had been often present at the like you see <newline> said he him that carves about his name is cutter and as often as <newline> he says cut he both calls and commands. <newline>  <newline> the humour spoiled my stomach for eating but turning to him that i <newline> might learn more i made some pleasant discourse to him at a distance <newline> and at last asked him what that woman was that so often scutled up and <newline> down the room <newline>  <newline> it is said he trimalchios wife her name fortunata she measures <newline> money by the bushel but what was she not long since pardon me sir <newline> you would not have touchd her with a pair of tongs but now no one <newline> knows how or wherefore shes got into heaven and is trimalchios all <newline> in all in short if she says it is midnight at midday hell <newline> believe her. hes so very wealthy he knows not what he has but she <newline> has an eye every where and when you least think to meet her shes <newline> void of all good counsel and withal of all ill tongue a very pye at <newline> his bolster whom she loves she loves and whom she does not love she <newline> does not love <newline>  <newline> then for trimalchio he has more lands than a crow can fly over <newline> monies upon monies there lies more silver in his porters lodge than <newline> any one mans whole estate. and for his family heyday heyday <newline> there is not so help me hercules one tenth of them that know their <newline> master. in brief there is not one of those fools about him but he <newline> can turn him into a cabbagestalk. nor is there any occasion to buy <newline> any thing he has all at his own door wooll marte pepper nay hens <newline> milk do but beat about and youll find it. in a word time was his <newline> wooll was none of the best and therefore he bought rams at tarentum <newline> to mend this breed an in like manner he did by his honey by bringing <newline> his bees from athens. it is not long since but he sent to the indies <newline> for mushroomseed nor has he so much as a mule that did not come of a <newline> wild ass. see you all these quilts there is not one of them whose <newline> wadding is not the finest combd wooll of violet or scarlet colour <newline> dyd in grain. o happy man but have a care how you put a slight on <newline> those freed men they are rich rogues see you him that sits at the <newline> lowerend of the table he has now the lord knows what and tis not <newline> long since he was not worth a groat and carried billets and faggots <newline> at his back it is said but i know nothing of it myself but as i <newline> have heard either he got in with an old hoggrubbler or had to do <newline> with an incubus and found a treasure for my part i envy no man if <newline> god gives anything it is a bit of a blow and wills no evil to himself <newline>  he lately set up this proclamation <newline>  <newline> c. pompeius diogenes has some lodgings <newline> to let for he hath bought a house. <newline>  <newline> but what think you of him who sits in the place of a late slave how <newline> well was he once i do not upbraid him he was once worth a hundred <newline> thousand sesterstias but has not now a hair of his head that is not <newline> engaged nor so help me hercules is it his own fault there is not a <newline> better humourd man than himself but those rascally freedmen have <newline> cheated him of all for know when the pot boyls and a mans estate <newline> declines farewell friends. and what trade do you think he drove he <newline> had the setting forth of grave mens funerals and with that eat like <newline> a prince he had his wild boars served up covered pastrymeats <newline> fowlcooks bakers more wine was thrown under his table than most men <newline> have in their cellars a meer phantasm and when his estate was going <newline> and he feared his creditors might fall upon him he made an auction <newline> under this title <newline>  <newline> julius proculus will make an auction <newline> of several goods he has no use of. <newline>  <newline> the dish was by this time taken away and the guests grown merry with <newline> wine began to talk of what was done abroad when trimalchio broke the <newline> discourse and leaning on his elbow this wine said he is worth <newline> drinking and fish must swim but do you think i am satisfied with <newline> that part of your supper you saw in the charger is ulysses no better <newline> known what then we ought to exercise our brains as well as our <newline> chaps and shew that we are not only lovers of learning but <newline> understand it peace rest my old tutors bones who made me a man <newline> amongst men no man can tell me any thing that is new to me for like <newline> him i am master of the practicks <newline>  <newline> this heaven thats inhabited by twelve gods turns it self into as <newline> many figures and now tis aries he thats born under that sign has <newline> much cattle much wooll and to that a jolthead a brazenface and <newline> will be certainly a cuckold there are many scholars advocates and <newline> horned beasts come into the world under this sign. we praised our <newline> nativitycasters pleasantness and he went on then again the whole <newline> heaven is taurus and wonder it eer bore footballplayers <newline> herdsmen and such as can shift for themselves. under gemini are <newline> foaled coachhorses oxen calved great baubles and such as can claw <newline> both sides are born. i was born my self under cancer and therefore <newline> stand on many feet as having large possessions both by sea and land <newline> for cancer suits one as well as the other and therefore i put nothing <newline> upon him that i might not press my own geniture. under leo <newline> spendthrifts and bullies under virgo women runagates and such as <newline> wear iron garters under libra butchers slipslopmakers and men of <newline> business under scorpio empoisoners and cutthroats under sagittary <newline> such as are goggleeyd herbwomen and baconstealers under <newline> capricorn poor helpless rascals to whom yet nature intended horns to <newline> defend themselves under aquarius cooks and paunchbellies under <newline> pisces caterers and orators and so the world goes round like a mill <newline> and is never without its mischief that men be either born or perish <newline> but for that tuft of herbs in the middle and the honeycomb upon it <newline> i do nothing without just reason for it our mother the earth is in <newline> the middle made round like an egg and has all good things in her <newline> self like a honeycomb. <newline>  <newline> most learnedly we all cryd and lifting our hands swore neither <newline> hipparebus nor aratus were to be compared to him till at last other <newline> servants came in and spread coverlets on the beds on which were <newline> painted nets men in ambush with huntingpoles and whatever <newline> appertained to hunting nor could we yet tell what to make of it when <newline> we heard a great cry without and a pack of beagles came and ran round <newline> the table and after them a large trey on which was a boar of the <newline> first magnitude with a cap on his head such as slaves at their <newline> making free had set on theirs in token of liberties on his tusks <newline> hung two wicker baskets the one full of dates the other of almonds <newline> and about him lay little pigs of marchpane as if they were sucking <newline> they signified a sow had farrowed and hang there as presents for the <newline> guests to carry away with them <newline>  <newline> to the cutting up this boar here came not he that had carried about <newline> the fowl as before but a swinging fellow with a twohanded beard <newline> buskins on his leggs and a short embroidered coat who drawing his <newline> woodknife made a large hole in the boars side out of which flew a <newline> company of blackbirds then fowlers stood ready with their engines and <newline> caught them in a trice as they fluttered about the room on which <newline> trimalchio ordering to every man his bird see said he what kind <newline> of acorns this wild boar fed on when presently the boys took off the <newline> baskets and distributed the dates and almonds among the guests <newline>  <newline> in the mean time i who had private thoughts of my own was much <newline> concerned to know why the boar was brought in with a cap upon his <newline> head and therefore having run out my tittletattle i told my <newline> interpreter what troubled me to which he answered your boy can even <newline> tell ye what it means for theres no riddle in it but all as clear <newline> as day. this boar stood the last of yesternights supper and <newline> dismissd by the guests returns now as a freeman among us. i curst <newline> my dulness and asked him no more questions that i might not be <newline> thought to have never eaten before with men of sense <newline>  <newline> while we were yet talking in came a handsome boy with a wreath of <newline> vine leaves and ivy about his head declaring himself one while <newline> bromius another while lyccus and another euphyus several names of <newline> bacchus he carried about a server of grapes and with a clear voice <newline> repeated some of his masters poetry at which trimalchio turning to <newline> him dionysius said he be thou liber i.e. free two other <newline> names of bacchus whereupon the boy took the cap from off the boars <newline> head and putting it on his own trimalchio added you will not deny <newline> me but i have a father liber. we all praised the conceit and <newline> soundly kissed the boy as he went round us <newline>  <newline> from this up rose trimalchio and went to the closestool we also <newline> being at liberty without a tyrant over us fell to some tabletalk <newline>  <newline> when presently one calling for a bumper the day said he is <newline> nothing tis night ere the scene turn and therefore nothing is <newline> better than to go straight from bed to board. we have had a great <newline> deal of frost the bagnio has scarce heated me but a warm drinking is <newline> my wardrobekeeper for my part i have spun this days thread the <newline> wine is got into my noddle and i am downright <newline>  <newline> selucus went on with the rest and i said he do not bathe every <newline> day for he where i use to bathe is a fuller cold water has teeth in <newline> it and my head grows every day more washy than others but when i <newline> have got my dose in my guts i bid defiance to cold nor could i well <newline> do it to day for i was at a funeral a jolly companion and a good <newline> man was he crysanthus has breathed his last tis not long since we <newline> were together and methinks i talk with him now. alas alas we are <newline> but blown bladders less than flies yet they have somewhat in them <newline> but we are meer bubbles. youll say he would not be ruld not a drop <newline> of water or crumb of bread went down his throat in five days and yet <newline> hes gone or that he died of the doctor. but i am of opinion his <newline> time was come for a physician is a great comfort. however he was <newline> well carried out of his house upon a rich bed and mightily lamented <newline> he made some of his servants free but his wife seemd not much <newline> concerned for him. youll say again he was not kind to her but women <newline> are a kind of kites whatever good is done them tis the same as if <newline> it were thrown in a well and old love is as bad as a goal. <newline>  <newline> at this philaos grew troublesome and cryed out let us remember the <newline> living he had what was due to him as he livd so he dyd and what <newline> has he now that any man moans the want of it he came from nothing <newline> and to his dyingday would have taken a farthing from a dunghil with <newline> his teeth therefore as he grew up he grew like a honeycomb. he <newline> dyd worth the lord knows what all ready money. but to the matter i <newline> have eaten a dogs tongue and dare speak truth he had a foul mouth <newline> was all babble a very makebate not a man. his brother was a brave <newline> fellow a friend to his friends of an open hand and kept a full <newline> table he did not order his affairs so well at first as he might have <newline> done but the first vintage made him up again for he sold what wine <newline> he would and what kept up his chin was the expectation of a <newline> reversion the credit of which brought him more than was left him for <newline> his brother taking a pelt at him devised the estate to i know not <newline> whose bastard he flies far that flies his relations. besides this <newline> brother of his had whisperers about him that were backfriends to the <newline> other but he shall never do right that is quick of belief especially <newline> in matter of business and yet tis true hell be counted wise while <newline> he lives to whom the thing whatever it be is given nor he that ought <newline> to have had it. he was without doubt one of fortunes sons lead in <newline> his hand would turn to gold and without trouble too where there are <newline> not rubbs in the way. and how many years think ye he livd <newline> seventyodd but he was as hard as horn bore his age well and as <newline> black as a crow <newline>  <newline> i knew him some years ago an oilman and to his last a good womans <newline> man but withal such a miser that so help me hercules i think he <newline> left not a dogg in his house. he was also a great whoremaster and a <newline> jack of all trades nor do i condemn him fort for this was the only <newline> secret he kept to himself and carryd with him. <newline>  <newline> thus phileros and gammedes as followeth ye talk of what concerns <newline> neither heaven nor earth when in the mean time no man regards what <newline> makes all victuals so scarce i could not so help me hercules get a <newline> mouthful of bread to day and how the drought continues for my <newline> part i have not filld my belly this twelvemonth a plague on these <newline> clerks of the market the baker and they juggle together take no <newline> notice of me ill take no notice of thee which make the poorer sort <newline> labour for nothing while those greater jawbones make festival every <newline> day. oh that we had those lyons i now find here when i first came <newline> out of asia that had been to live the inner part of sicily had the <newline> like of them but they so handled the goblins even jupiter bore them <newline> no goodwill. i remember safinius when i was a boy he livd by the <newline> old arch youd have taken him for peppercorn rather than a man <newline> whereever he went the earth parched under him yet he was honest at <newline> bottom one might depend on him a friend to his friend and whom you <newline> might boldly trust in the dark. but how did he behave himself on the <newline> bench he tossd every one like a ball made no starchd speeches <newline> but downright as he were doing himself what he would persuade <newline> others but in the market his noise was like a trumpet without <newline> sweating or spueing. i fancy he had somewhat i know not what of the <newline> asian humour then so ready to return a salute and call every one by <newline> his name as if he had been one of us. in his time corn was as common <newline> as loam you might have bought more bread for half a farthing than <newline> any two could eat but now the eye of an ox will cost you twice as <newline> much alas alas we are every day worse and worse and grow like a <newline> cows tail downward and why all this we have a clerk of the market <newline> not worth three figgs and values more the getting of a doit himself <newline> than any of our lives tis this makes him laugh in his sleeve for he <newline> gets more money in a day than many an honest mans whole estate i <newline> know not how he got the estate he has but if we had any thing of men <newline> about us he would not hug himself as he does but now the people are <newline> grown to this pass that they are lyons at home and foxes abroad for <newline> my part i have eaten up my cloaths already and if corn holds at the <newline> rate it does i shall be forcd to sell house and all for what will <newline> become of us if neither gods nor men pity us let me never enjoy my <newline> friends more than i believe all this comes from heaven for no one <newline> thinks there is any such thing no one keeps a fast or value jupiter <newline> a hair but shuts his eyes and reckons what he is worth. time was <newline> when matrons went barefoot with disheveld hair pure minds and <newline> prayd him to send rain and forthwith it rained pitcherfulls or <newline> then or never and every one was pleased now the gods are no better <newline> than mice as they tread their feet are wrapt in wooll and because <newline> ye are not superstitious your lands yield nothing. <newline>  <newline> more civilly i beseech ye said echion the hundredconstable it <newline> is one while this way and another while that said the countryman <newline> when he lost his speckled hogg what is not to day may be to morrow <newline> and thus is life hurried about so help me hercules a country is said <newline> not to be the better that it has many people in it tho ours at <newline> present labours under that difficulty but it is no fault of hers we <newline> must not be so nice heaven is equally distant every where were you <newline> in another place youd say hoggs walked here ready dressd and now i <newline> think ont we shall have an excellent show these holydays a <newline> fencingprize exhibited to the people not of slaves bought for that <newline> purpose but most of them freemen. our patron titus has a large soul <newline> but a very devil in his drink and cares not a straw which side gets <newline> the better i think i should know him for i belong to him hes of a <newline> right breed both by father and mother no mongril. they are well <newline> provided with weapons and will fight it out to the last the theatre <newline> will look like a butchers shambles and he has wherewithal to do it <newline> his father left him a vast sum and let him make ducks and drakes with <newline> it never so much the estate will bear it and he always carries the <newline> reputation of it. he has his waggon horses a womancarter and <newline> glycos steward who was taken abed with his mistress what a busles <newline> here between cuckolds and cuckoldmakers but this glyco a <newline> moneybroker condemned his steward to fight with beasts and what was <newline> that but to expose himself for another where lay the servants crime <newline> who perhaps was obligd to do what he did she rather deservd to be <newline> braind than the bull that tossed her but he that cannot come at the <newline> arse thrashes at the packsaddle yet how could glyco expect <newline> hermogines daughter should make a good end shed have pared the <newline> claws of a flying kite a snake does not bring forth a halter glyco <newline> might do what he would with his own but it will be a brand on him as <newline> long as he lives nor can any thing but hell blot it out however <newline> every mans faults are his own. i perceive now what entertainment <newline> mammea is like to give us hell be at twopence charges for me and my <newline> company which if he does he will pull narbanus clean out of favour <newline> for you must know hell live at the full height yet in truth what <newline> good has he done us he gave us a company of gittiful swordplayers <newline> but so old and decrepid that had you blown on them theyd have <newline> fallen of themselves i have seen many a better at a funeral pile he <newline> would not be at the charge of lamps for them youd have taken them <newline> for dunghil cocks fighting in the dark one was a downright fool and <newline> withal gouty another crumpfooted and a third half dead and <newline> hamstrung there was one of them a thracian that made a figure and <newline> kept up to the rule of fighting but upon the whole matter all of <newline> them were parted and nothing came of this great blockheaded rabble <newline> but a downright running away and yet said he i made ye a show and <newline> i clap my hands for company but cast up the account i gave more than <newline> i received one hand rubs another. you agamemnon seem to tell me what <newline> would that trouble some fellow be at because you that can speak and <newline> do not you are not of our form and therefore ridicule what poor men <newline> say tho saving the repute of a scholar we know you are but a meer <newline> fool. where lies the matter then let me persuade you to take a walk <newline> in the country and see our cottage youll find somewhat to eat a <newline> chicken some eggs or the like the tempestuous season had like to <newline> have broke us all yet well get enough to fill the belly. your <newline> scholar my boy cicero is mightily improved and if he lives youll <newline> have a servant of him he is pretty forward already and whatever <newline> spare time he has never off a book hes a witty lad wellfeaturd <newline> takes a thing without much study tho yet he be sickly i killed <newline> three of his linnets the other day and told him the weasels had eaten <newline> them yet he found other things to play with and has a pretty knack <newline> at painting he has a perfect aversion to greek but seems better <newline> inclined to latin tho the master he has now humours him in the <newline> other nor can he be kept to one thing but is still craving more and <newline> will not take pains with any. there is also another of this sort not <newline> much troubled with learning but very diligent and teaches more than <newline> he knows himself he comes to our house on holidays and whatever you <newline> give him hes contented i therefore bought the boy some ruled books <newline> because i will have him get a smattering in accounts and the law it <newline> will be his own another day he has learning enough already but if he <newline> takes back to it again i design him for a trade a barber a parson <newline> or a lawyer which nothing but the devil can take from him how oft <newline> have i told him thou art sirrah my first begotten and believe thy <newline> father whatever thou learnest tis all thy own see there philero the <newline> lawyer if he had not been a scholar he might have starved but now <newline> see what trinkums he has about his neck and dares nose narbanus <newline> letters are a treasure and a trade never dies. <newline>  <newline> thus or the like we were bandying it about when trimalchio returnd <newline> and having wipd the slops from his face washd his hands and in a <newline> very little time pardon me my friends said he i have been <newline> costive for several days and my physicians were to seek about it <newline> when a suppository of pomegranate wine with the liquor of a pinetree <newline> and vinegar relieved me and now i hope my belly may be ashamed if it <newline> keep no better order for otherwise i have such a rumbling in my guts <newline> youd think an ox bellowed and therefore if any of you has a mind he <newline> need not blush for the matter theres not one of us born without some <newline> defect or other and i think no torment greater than wanting the <newline> benefit of going to stool which is the only thing even jupiter <newline> himself cannot prevent and do you laugh fortunata you that break me <newline> so often of my sleep by nights i never denyed any man do that in my <newline> room might pleasure himself and physicians will not allow us to keep <newline> any thing in our bodies longer than we needs must or if ye have any <newline> farther occasion every thing is ready in the next room water <newline> chamberpots closestools or whatever else ye may need believe me <newline> this being hardbound if it get into the head disturbs the whole <newline> body i have known many a man lost by it when they have been so <newline> modest to themselves as not to tell what they ailed. <newline>  <newline> we thankd him for his freeness and the liberty he gave us when yet <newline> to suppress our laughter we set the glasses about again nor did we <newline> yet know that in the midst of such dainties we were as they say to <newline> clamber another hill for the cloth being again taken away upon the <newline> next musick were brought in three fat hogs with collars and bells <newline> about their necks and he that had the charge of them told us the one <newline> was two years old the other three and the third full grown. i took <newline> it at first to have been a company of tumblers and that the hogs as <newline> the manner is were to have shewn us some tricks in a ring till <newline> trimalchio breaking my expectation which of them said he will ye <newline> have for supper for cocks pheasants and the like trifles are but <newline> country fare but my cooks have coppers will boil a calf whole and <newline> therewith commanding a cook to be called for he prevented our choice <newline> by ordering him to kill the largest and with a loud voice asked him <newline> of what rank of servants in that house he was to which he answering <newline> of the fortieth were you bought said the other or born in my <newline> house neither said the cook but left you by pansas <newline> testament. see then said trimalchio that you dress it as it <newline> should be or ill send you to the galleys. on which the cook <newline> advertised of his power went into the kitchin to mind his charge <newline>  <newline> but trimalchio turning to us with a pleasanter look asked if the wine <newline> pleased us if not said he ill have it changed and if it does <newline> let me see it by your drinking i thank the gods i do not buy it but <newline> have everything that may get an appetite growing on my own grounds <newline> without the city which no man that i know but my self has and yet it <newline> has been taken for tarracino and taranto. i have a project to joyn <newline> sicily to my lands on the continent that when i have a mind to go <newline> into africa i may sail by my own coasts. but prithee agamemnon tell <newline> me what mootpoint was it you argued to day for tho i plead no <newline> causes my self yet i have had a share of letters in my time and that <newline> you may not think me sick of them now have three libraries the one <newline> greek the other two latin therefore as you love me tell me what was <newline> the state of the question the poor and the rich are enemies said <newline> agamemnon and what is poor answered trimalchio spoke like a <newline> gentleman replyed agamemnon. but making nothing of the matter if <newline> it be so said trimalchio where lies the dispute and if it be not <newline> so tis nothing. <newline>  <newline> while we all hummd this and the like stuff i beseech ye said he <newline> my dear agamemnon do you remember the twelve labours of hercules or <newline> the story of ulysses how a cyclop put his thumb out of joint with a <newline> mawkin i read such things in homer when i was a boy nay saw my <newline> self the sybil of curna hanging in a glass bottle and when the boys <newline> asked her sybil what wouldst thou she answered i would die. <newline>  <newline> he had not yet run to the end of the rope when an overgrown hog was <newline> brought to the table. we all wondered at the quickness of the thing <newline> and swore a capon could not be dressd in the time and that the more <newline> because the hog seemed larger than was the boar we had a little <newline> before when trimalchio looking more intent upon him what what <newline> said he are not his guts taken out no so help me hercules they <newline> are not bring hither bring hither this rogue of a cook. and when <newline> he stood hanging his head before us and said he was so much in haste <newline> he forgot it. how forgot it cryd out trimalchio do ye think <newline> he has given it no reasoning of pepper and cummin strip him when <newline> in a trice twas done and himself set between two tormentors <newline> however we all interceded for him as a fault that might now and then <newline> happen and therefore begd his pardon but if he ever did the like <newline> there was no one would speak for him tho for my part i think he <newline> deserved what he got and so turning to agamemnons ear this <newline> fellow said i must be a naughty knave could any one forget to <newline> bowel a hog i would not so help me hercules have forgiven him if <newline> he had served me so with a single fish. but trimalchio it seems had <newline> somewhat else in his head for falling a laughing you said he <newline> that have so short a memory lets see if you can do it now. on <newline> which the cook having gotten his coat again took up a knife and <newline> with a feigned trembling rippd up the hogs belly long and thwart <newline> when immediately its own weight tumbled out a heap of hogspuddings <newline> and sausages <newline>  <newline> after this as it had been done of it self the family gave a shout <newline> and cryd out health and prosperity to caius the cook also was <newline> presented with wine a silver coronet and a drinking goblet on a <newline> broad corinthian plate which agamemnon more narrowly viewing i am <newline> said trimalchio the only person that has the true corinthian <newline> vessels. <newline>  <newline> i expected that according to the rest of his haughtiness he would <newline> have told us they had been brought him from corinth but he better <newline> and perhaps said he youll ask me why i am the only person that <newline> have them. and why but the coppersmith from whom i buy them is <newline> called corinthus and what is corinthian but what is made by <newline> corinthus but that ye may not take me for a man of no sence i <newline> understand well enough whence the word first came. when troy was <newline> taken hannibal a cunning fellow but withal mischievous made a pile <newline> of all the brazen gold and silver statues and burnt them together <newline> and thence came this mixt metal which workmen afterwards carried off <newline> and of this mass made platters dishes and several other things so <newline> that these vessels are neither this nor that metal but made of all of <newline> them. pardon me what i say however others may be of another mind i <newline> had rather have glass ware and if it were not so subject to <newline> breaking id reckon it before gold but now it is of no esteem <newline>  <newline> there was a coppersmith that made glass vessels of that pliant <newline> harness that they were no more to be broken than gold and silver <newline> ones it so happened that having made a drinkingpot with a wide <newline> mouth of that kind but the finest glass fit for no man as he <newline> thought less than csar himself he went with his present to <newline> csar and had admittance the kind of the gift was praised the <newline> hand of the workman commended and the design of the giver accepted <newline> he again that he might turn the admiration of the beholders into <newline> astonishment and work himself the more into the emperors favour <newline> prayd the glass out of the emperors hand and having received it <newline> threw it with such a force against the paved floor that the most <newline> solid and firmest metal could not but have received some hurt thereby <newline> csar also was no less amazed at it than concerned for it but the <newline> other took up the pot from the ground not broken but bulgd a little <newline> as if the substance of metal had put on the likeness of a glass and <newline> therewith taking a hammer out of his pocket he hammerd it as it had <newline> been a brass kettle and beat out the bruise and now the fellow <newline> thought himself in heaven in having as he fansied gotten the <newline> acquaintance of csar and the admiration of all but it fell out <newline> quite contrary csar asking him if any one knew how to make this <newline> malleable glass but himself and he answering there was not the <newline> emperor commanded his head to be struck off for said he if this <newline> art were once known gold and silver will be of no more esteem than <newline> dirt. <newline>  <newline> and for silver i more than ordinarily affect it i have several <newline> waterpots more or less whereon is the story how cassandra killed her <newline> sons and the dead boys are so well embossed youd think them real <newline> i have also a drinking cup left me by an advocate of mine where <newline> ddalus puts niobe into the trojan horse as also that other of <newline> hermerotes that they may stand as a testimony theres truth in cups <newline> and all this massy ror will i part with what i understand of them at <newline> any rate. <newline>  <newline> while he was thus talking a cup dropt out of a boys hand on which <newline> trimalchio looking over his shoulder at him bad him begone and kill <newline> himself immediately for said he thou art careless and mindst <newline> not what thou art about. the boy hung his lip and besought him but <newline> he said what dost thou beseech me as if i required some difficult <newline> matter of thee i only bid thee obtain this of thy self that thou be <newline> not careless again. but at last he discharged him upon our entreaty <newline> on this the boy run round the table and cryd water without doors <newline> and wine within. we all took the jest but more especially <newline> agamemnon who knew on what account himself had been brought thither <newline>  <newline> trimalchio in the mean time hearing himself commended drank all the <newline> merrier and being within an ace of quite out will none of you <newline> said he invite my fortunata to dance believe me theres no one <newline> leads a country dance better and with that tossing his hands round <newline> his head fell to act a jackpudding the family all the while <newline> singing youth it self most exactly youth it self  and he had <newline> gotten into the middle of the room but that fortunata whispered him <newline> and i believe told him such gambols did not become his gravity. nor <newline> was there any thing more uneven to it self for one while he turned to <newline> his fortunata and another while to his natural inclination but what <newline> disturbed the pleasure of her dancing was his notaries coming in <newline> who as they had been the acts of a common council read aloud <newline>  <newline> vii. of the calends of august born in trimalchios manner of cumanum <newline> thirty boys and forty girls brought from the threshingfloor into the <newline> granary five hundred thousand bushels of wheat. the same day broke <newline> out a fire in a pleasuregarden that was pompeys first began in one <newline> of his bayliffs houses. <newline>  <newline> hows this said trimalchio when were those gardens bought for <newline> me the year before answered his notary and therefore not yet <newline> brought to account. <newline>  <newline> at this trimalchio fell into a fume and whatever lands said he <newline> shall be bought me hereafter if i hear nothing of it in six months <newline> let them never i charge ye be brought to any account of mine. then <newline> also were read the orders of the clerks of the markets and the <newline> testaments of his woodwards rangers and parkkeepers by which they <newline> disinherited their relations and with ample praise of him declare <newline> trimalchio their heir. next that the names of his bayliffs and how <newline> one of them that made his circuits in the country turned off his wife <newline> for having taken her in bed with a barber the doorkeeper of his <newline> baths turnd out of his place the auditor found short in his <newline> accounts and the dispute between the grooms of his chamber ended <newline>  <newline> at last came in the dancers on the rope and a gorbellyd blockhead <newline> standing out with a ladder commanded his boy to hopp every round <newline> singing and dance a jigg on the top of it and then tumble through <newline> burning hoops of iron with a glass in his mouth. trimalchio was the <newline> only person that admird it but withal said he did not like it but <newline> there were two things he could willingly behold and they were the <newline> flyers on the high rope and quails and that all other creatures and <newline> shows were meer gewgaws for said he i bought once a sett of <newline> stroulers and chose rather to make them merryandrews than comedians <newline> and commanded my bagpiper to sing in latin to them. <newline>  <newline> while he was chattering all at this rate a boy chanced to stumble <newline> upon him on which the family gave a shriek the same also did the <newline> guests not for such a beast of a man whose neck they could willingly <newline> have seen broken but for fear the supper should break up ill and <newline> they be forcd to wail the death of the boy <newline>  <newline> whatever it were trimalchio gave a deep groan and leaning upon his <newline> arm as if it had been hurt the physicians ran thick about him and <newline> with the first fortunata her hair about her ears a bottle of wine <newline> in her hand still howling miserable unfortunate woman that she was <newline> undone undone. the boy on the other hand ran under our feet and <newline> beseeched us to procure him a discharge but i was much concernd <newline> lest our interposition might make an ill end of the matter for the <newline> cook that had forgotten to bowel the hog was still in my thoughts. i <newline> began therefore to look about the room for fear somewhat or other <newline> might drop through the ceiling while the servant that had bound up <newline> his arm in white not scarletcolour flannen was soundly beaten now <newline> was i much out for instead of another course came in an order of <newline> trimalchios by which he gave the boy his freedom that it might not <newline> be said so honourable a person had been hurt by his slave. we all <newline> commended the action but chatted among our selves with what little <newline> consideration the things of this world were done. youre in the <newline> right said trimalchio nor ought this accident to pass without <newline> booking and so calling for the journal commanded it to be entered <newline> and with as little thought tumbled out these verses <newline>  <newline> whats least expected falls into our dish <newline> and fortunes more indulgent than our wish <newline> therefore boy fill the generous wine about. <newline>  <newline> this epigram gave occasion to talk of the poets and marsus the <newline> trachian carryd the bays a long while till trimalchio turning to <newline> some wit amongst them i beseech ye master of mine said he tell <newline> me what difference take ye between cicero the orator and publius the <newline> poet for my part i think one was more eloquent the other the <newline> honester man for what could be said better than this. <newline>  <newline> now sinking rome grows weak with luxury <newline> to please her appetite cramd peacocks die <newline> their gaudy plumes a modish dress supply <newline>  <newline> for her the guinnea hen and capons drest <newline> the stork it self for romes luxurious taste <newline> must in a caldron build its humbld nest <newline>  <newline> that foreign friendly pious longlegd thing <newline> grateful that with shrill sounding notes dost sing <newline> all winters gone yet ushers in the spring <newline> why in one ring must three rich pearls be worn <newline> but that your wives th exhausted seas adorn <newline> abroad t increase their lust at home their scorn <newline>  <newline> why is the costly emerald so desird <newline> or richer glittering carbuncle admird <newline> because they sparkle ist with that youre fird <newline> well honestys a jewel. now none knows <newline> a modest bride from a kept whore by er cloaths <newline> for cobweb lawns both spouse and wench expose. <newline>  <newline> but now we talk after the rate of the learned which said he are <newline> the most difficult trades i think a physician and a banker a <newline> physician because he knows a mans very heart and when the fits of <newline> an ague will return tho by the way i hate them mortally for by <newline> their good will i should have nothing but slubberslops and a banker <newline> because hell find out a piece of brass money tho plated with <newline> silver <newline>  <newline> there are also brute beasts sheep and oxen laborious in their kind <newline> oxen to whom we are beholding for the bread we eat and sheep for <newline> the wooll that makes us so fine. but o horrid we both eat the <newline> mutton and make us warm with the fleece. i take the bees for divine <newline> creatures they give us honey tho tis said they stole it from <newline> jupiter and thats the reason why they sting for whereever ye meet <newline> any thing thats sweet youll ever find a sting at the end of it. <newline>  <newline> he also excluded philosophers from business while the memoirs of the <newline> family were carrying round the table and a boy set for that purpose <newline> read aloud the names of the presents appointed for the guests to <newline> carry home with them. wicked silver what can it not then a gammon <newline> of bacon was set on the table and above that several sharp sauces a <newline> nightcap for himself puddingpies and i know not what kind of <newline> birds there was also brought in a rundlet of wine boiled off a third <newline> part and kept under ground to preserve its strength there were also <newline> several other things i can give no account of besides apples <newline> scallions peaches a whip a knife and what had been sent him as <newline> sparrows a flyeflap raisons attick honey nightgowns judges <newline> robes dryd paste tablebooks with a pipe and a footstool after <newline> which came in an hare and a solefish and there was further sent him <newline> a lamprey a waterrat with a frog at his tail and a bundle of <newline> beets <newline>  <newline> long time we smiled at these and five hundred the like that have now <newline> slipt my memory but now when ascyltos who could not moderate <newline> hirnself held up his hands and laught at every thing nay so <newline> downright that he was ready to cry a freeman of trimalchios that <newline> sate next above me grew hot upont and what said he thou sheep <newline> what dost thou laugh at does not this sumptuousness of my master <newline> please you youre richer forsooth and eat better every day so may <newline> the guardian of this place favour me as had i sate near him id hit <newline> him a box on the ear ere this a hopeful cullion that mocks others <newline> some pitiful nightwalker not worth the very urine he makes and <newline> should i throw mine on him knows not where to dry himself. i am not <newline> so help me hercules quickly angry yet worms are bred even in tender <newline> flesh. he laughs what has he to laugh at what wooll did his father <newline> give for the bantling is he a roman knight i am the son of a king <newline> how came i then youll say to serve another i did it of my self <newline> and had rather be a citizen of rome than a tributary king and now <newline> hope to live so as to be no mans jeast. i walk like other men with <newline> an open face and can shew my head among the best for i owe no man a <newline> groat i never had an action brought against me or said to me on the <newline> exchange pay me what thou owest me. i bought some acres in the <newline> country and have everything suitable to it i feed twenty mouths <newline> besides dogs i ransomed my bondwoman lest another should wipe his <newline> hands on her smock and between our selves she cost me more than ill <newline> tell ye at present. i was made a captain of horse gratis and hope so <newline> to die that i shall have no occasion to blush in my grave but art <newline> thou so prying into others that thou never considerest thy self <newline> canst thou spy a louse on another mans coat and not see the tyck on <newline> thy own your master then is ancienter than your self and t please <newline> him but yet thou whose milk is not yet out of thy nose that canst <newline> not say boh to a goose must you be making observations are you the <newline> wealthier man if you are dine twice and sup twice for my part i <newline> value my credit more than treasures upon the whole matter wheres <newline> the man that ever dunnd me twice thou pipkin of a man more limber <newline> but nothing better than a strap of wet leather i have served forty <newline> years in this house came into it with my hair full grown this palace <newline> was not then built yet i made it my business to please my master a <newline> person of honour the parings of whose nails are more worth than thy <newline> whole body. i met several rubs in my way but by the help of my good <newline> angel i broke through them all this is truth it is as easie to make <newline> a huntinghorn of a sows tail as to get into this company. what <newline> make ye in a dump now like a goat at a heap of stones <newline>  <newline> on this gito who stood behind him burst out a laughing which the <newline> other taking notice of fell upon the boy and do you said he <newline> laugh too you curlpated chattering magpye o the saturnals why <newline> how now sirrah is it the month of december when were you twenty i <newline> pray what would this collop dropt from the gibbet this crowsmeat <newline> be at ill find some or other way for jupiter to plague thee and <newline> him that bred thee no better or never let me eat a good mealsmeat <newline> again i could sirrah but for the companies sake i spare thee tho <newline> either we understand not aright or they are sots themselves that <newline> carry no better a hand over thee for without doubt it is true like <newline> master like man. i am hot by nature and can scarce contain my self <newline> give me but a mess of peaseporridge and i care not twopence for my <newline> mother. very well i shall meet thee abroad thou mouse nay rather <newline> molehill. may i never thrive more but ill drive that master of <newline> thine into a blade of rue nor shalt thou so help me hercules scape <newline> me tho thou couldst call in jupiter to thy aid i shall off with <newline> those locks and take thee when that trifling master of thine shall be <newline> out of the way thou wilt certainly fall into my hands and either i <newline> know not my self or ill make thee leave that buffoonry tho thy <newline> beard were of gold ill have thee bruised in a mortar and him that <newline> first taught thee i never studied geometry criticism and meer words <newline> without sence but i understand the fitting of stones for buildings <newline> can run you over a hundred things as to metal weight coin and that <newline> to a tittle if you have a mind you and i will try it between us ill <newline> lay thee a wager thou wizard and tho i am wholly ignorant of <newline> rhetorick thoult presently see thou hast lost let no one run about <newline> the bush to me i come up to him resolve me i say which of us <newline> runs yet stirs not out of his place which of us grows bigger and <newline> yet is less. do you scamper cant you tell what to make of it that <newline> you look so like a mouse in a trap therefore either hold thy tongue <newline> or dont provoke a better man than thy self who does not think thee <newline> framd of nature unless thou fansiest me taken with those yellow <newline> curld locks which thou hast already vowed to some whore or other. o <newline> lucky opportunity come lets walk the exchange and see which of us <newline> can take up money youll be satisfied then this iron has credit <newline> upont a pretty thing is it not a drunken fox. so may i gain while <newline> i live and die well but the people will brain me if i follow not <newline> that coat on thy back which is not for thy wearing whereever thou <newline> goest hes a precious tool too whoever he were that taught thee a <newline> piece of green cheese no master. i have learnd as well as another <newline> man and my master said it would be my own another day. save your <newline> worship get home as fast as you can but look well about you and <newline> have a care how you speak irreverently of your betters or vie estates <newline> with them he that does it his purse shall feel it for my self that <newline> you see me as i am i thank my stars for the art i have. <newline>  <newline> ascyltos was making answer to his railing when trimalchio pleased <newline> with that good grace of speaking go to said he no more of this <newline> wild talk let us rather be pleasant and you hermeros bear with the <newline> youngman his blood boils be thou the soberer man he that is <newline> overcome in this matter goes off conqueror even thy self when thou <newline> wert such another capon hadst nothing but coco coco and no heart at <newline> all. let us therefore which is the better of the two be heartily <newline> merry and expect some admirers of homer that will be here <newline> presently. <newline>  <newline> nor were the words scarce out of his mouth when in came a band of <newline> men and made a rustling with their spears and targets. trimalchio <newline> leaned on his pillow the homerists ratled out greek verses as <newline> arrogantly enough they were wont to do and he read a latin book with <newline> a loud voice whereupon silence being made know ye said he what <newline> fable they were upon <newline>  <newline> diomedes and ganymede were two brothers and helen was their sister <newline> agamemnon stole him away and shammd diana with a hind in his room <newline> as says homer in this place and how the trojans and the parentines <newline> fought among themselves but at last he got the better of it and <newline> married his daughter iphigenia to achilles on which ajax run mad <newline> and theres an end of the tale. <newline>  <newline> on this the homerists set up a shout and a young boiled heifer with <newline> an helmet on her head was handed in upon a mighty charger ajax <newline> followed and with a drawn sword as if he were mad made at it now <newline> in one place then in another still acting a morrisdancer till <newline> having cut it into joints he took them upon the point of his sword <newline> and distributed them. nor had we much time to admire the conceit for <newline> of a sudden the roof gave a crack and the whole room shook for my <newline> part i got on my feet but all in confusion for fear some tumbler <newline> might drop on my head the same also were the rest of the guests <newline> still gaping and expecting what new thing should come from the clouds <newline> when straight the main beams opened and a vast circle was let down <newline> all round which hung golden garlands and alabaster pots of sweet <newline> ointments <newline>  <newline> while we were required to take up these presents i chanced to cast an <newline> eye upon the table where there lay a fresh service of cheesecakes <newline> and tarts and in the midst of them a lusty rundlet stuck round with <newline> all sorts of apples and grapes as they commonly draw that figure <newline>  <newline> we greedily reached our hands towards it when of a sudden a new <newline> diversion gave us fresh mirth for all the cheesecakes apples and <newline> tarts upon the least touch threw out a delicious liquid perfurne <newline> which fell upon us <newline>  <newline> we judging the mess to be sacred that was so gorgeously set out <newline> stood up and began a health to the august founder the father of his <newline> country after which reverence failing to catch that catch could we <newline> filled our napkins and i chiefly who thought nothing too good for my <newline> boy gito <newline>  <newline> during this in came three boys in white their coats tuckd about <newline> them of whom two set on the table three household gods with broaches <newline> about their necks and the other bearing round us a goblet of wine <newline> cryd aloud be the gods favourable the name of this said he <newline> is cobler that others goodluck and the thirds spendall and as <newline> the image of trimalchio was carryed round and every one kissd it we <newline> thought it a shame not to do as the rest of the company <newline>  <newline> after this when all of us had wished him health and happiness <newline> trimalchio turning to niceros you were wont said he to be a <newline> good companion but whats the matter we get not a word from ye now <newline> let me entreat ye as you would see me happy do not break an old <newline> custom. <newline>  <newline> niceros pleased with the frankness of his friend let me never <newline> thrive said he if i am not ready to caper out of my skin to see <newline> you in so good a humours therefore what i say shall be all mirth <newline> tho i am afraid those grave fopps may laugh but let them look to t <newline> ill go on nevertheless for what am i the worse for any one swearing <newline> i had rather they laugh at what i say than at my self. <newline>  <newline> thus when he spake he began this tale <newline>  <newline> while i was yet a servant we livd in a narrow lane now the house of <newline> gavilla there as the gods would have it i fell in love with <newline> tarentiuss wife he kept an eatinghouse. ye all knew melissa <newline> tarentina a pretty little punchingblock and withal beautiful but <newline> so help me hercules i minded her not so much for the matter of the <newline> point of that as that she was goodhumourd if i asked her any <newline> thing she never denyd me and what money i had i trusted her with <newline> it nor did she ever fail me when id occasion. it so happened that <newline> a shecompanion of hers had dyd in the country and she was gone <newline> thither how to come at her i could not tell but a friend is seen at <newline> a dead lift it also happened my master was gone to capua to dispatch <newline> somewhat or other i laid hold of the opportunity and persuaded mine <newline> host to take an evenings walk of four or five miles out of town for <newline> he was a stout fellow and as bold as a devil the moon shone as <newline> bright as day and about cockcrowing we fell in with a buryingplace <newline> and certain monument of the dead my man loitered behind me <newline> astargazing and i sitting expecting him fell a singing and <newline> numbering them when looking round me what should i see but mine host <newline> stript starknaked and his cloaths lying by the highwayside. the <newline> sight struck me every where and i stood as if i had been dead but he <newline> pissd round his cloaths and of a sudden was turned to a wolf dont <newline> think i jest i value no mans estate at that rate as to tell a lye <newline> but as i was saying after he was turned to a wolf he set up a howl <newline> and fled to the woods. at first i knew not where i was till going to <newline> take up his cloaths i found them also turnd to stone. another man <newline> would have dyd for fear but i drew my sword and slaying all the <newline> ghosts that came in my way lighted at last on the place where my <newline> mistress was i entered the first door my eyes were sunk in my head <newline> the sweat ran off me by more streams than one and i was just <newline> breathing my last without thought of recovery when my melissa coming <newline> up to me began to wonder why id be walking so late and if said <newline> she you had come a little sooner you might have done us a kindness <newline> for a wolf came into the farm and has made butchers work enough among <newline> the cattle but tho he got off he has no reason to laugh for a <newline> servant of ours ran him through the neck with a pitchfork. as soon as <newline> i heard her i could not hold open my eyes any longer and ran home by <newline> daylight like a vintner whose house had been robbd but coming by <newline> the place where the cloaths were turned to stone i saw nothing but a <newline> puddle of blood and when i got home found mine host lying abed like <newline> an oxe in his stall and a chirurgeon dressing his neck. i understood <newline> afterwards he was a fellow that could change his skin but from that <newline> day forward could never eat a bit of bread with him no if youd <newline> have killd me. let them that dont believe me examine the truth of <newline> it may your good angels plague me as i tell ye a lye. <newline>  <newline> the company were all wondring when saving what you have said <newline> quoth trimalchio if there be faith in man my hair stands on end <newline> because i know niceros is no trifler hes sure of what he says and <newline> not given to talking nay ill tell ye as horrible a thing my self <newline> but see there whats that behind the hangings <newline>  <newline> when i was yet a longhaird boy for even then i livd a pleasant <newline> life i had a minion and he dyd he was so help me hercules a <newline> pearl a paragon nay perfection it self but when the poor mother <newline> lamented him and we also were doing the same some witches got round <newline> the house on a sudden youd have taken them for hounds hunting a <newline> hare. we had then in the house a cappadocian a tall fellow stout <newline> and hardy that would not have stept an inch out of his way for <newline> jupiter. he boldly drew his sword and wrapping his coat about his <newline> left arm leaped out of the house and as it might be here no hurt <newline> to the thing i touch ran a woman clean through. we heard a pitiful <newline> groan but not to lye saw none of them. our champion came in and <newline> threw himself on a bed but all black and blue so he had been troshd <newline> with flails for it seems some ill hand had touched him. we shut the <newline> door and went on with our mourning but the mother taking her son in <newline> her arms and stroaking him found nothing but a bolster of straw it <newline> had neither heart entrals nor any thing for the fairies belike had <newline> stollen him out of his cradle and left that of straw instead of him <newline> give me credit i beseech ye women are craftier than we are play <newline> their tricks by night and turn every thing topsyturvy. after this <newline> our tall fellow never came to his colour again but in a few days died <newline> ravingmad. <newline>  <newline> we all wondred as not doubting what he said and kissing the table in <newline> reverence to him prayd the privilege of the night and that our <newline> places might be kept till we returned <newline>  <newline> and now we thought the lamps lookd double and the whole room seemd <newline> quite another thing when trimalchio again i speak to you plorimus <newline> wont you come in for a share will ye entertain us with nothing <newline> thou usedst to be a pleasant companion couldst sing a song and tell a <newline> tale with the best but alas alas the sweetmeats are gone. my <newline> horses said the other ran away with my coach i have been troubled <newline> with the gout ever since. when i was a young fellow i sung so long i <newline> had well nigh brought my self into a consumption. what do ye tell me <newline> of songs tales or barber shops who ever came near me but one only <newline> apelles and with setting his hand to his mouth whistled out <newline> somewhat i know not what which afterwards he swore was greek <newline> trimalchio also when he mimicked the trumpets looked on his minion <newline> and called him crsus yet the boy was bleareyed and swathing up <newline> a little black bitch with nasty teeth and overgrown with fat in <newline> green swadlingclouts he set half a loaf on the table which she <newline> refusing he cramd her with it on which trimalchio commanded the <newline> guardian of his house and family scylax to be brought when <newline> presently was led in a beautiful mastiff in a chain who having a hint <newline> given him by a knock of the porters foot lay down before the table <newline> whereupon trimalchio throwing him a manchet theres no one said <newline> he in this house of mine loves me better than this dog. the boy <newline> taking it in dudgeon that scylax should be so commended laid the <newline> bitch on the floor and challenged the dog to have a rubber with him <newline> on this scylax after the manner of dogs set up such a hideous <newline> barking that it filld the room and snapping at him almost rent off <newline> a brooch that hung on crsuss breast nor did the scuffle end <newline> here for the great candle being overturnd on the table broke all <newline> the chrystal glasses and threw the scalding oil on the guests <newline>  <newline> trimalchio not to seem concerned at the loss kissed the boy and <newline> commanded him to get on his back nor was it long ere he was a <newline> cockhorse and slapping his masters shoulders and laughing cryd <newline> out fool fool and how many of them have we here <newline>  <newline> trimalchio thus kept under for a while commanded a bumper to be <newline> filld and given round to the waiters with this further that <newline> whosoever refused it should have it poured down his collar. thus one <newline> while we were grave and other while merry <newline>  <newline> after this came junkets and made dishes the very remembrance of <newline> which if i may be believed will not yet down with me for there were <newline> several cramd hens given about under the notion of thrushes and <newline> goose eggs with caps upon them which trimalchio nor without <newline> ostentation pressd us to eat adding withal that their bones were <newline> taken out <newline>  <newline> nor were the words scarce out of his mouth when a beadle rappd at <newline> the door and one in white with a company of roisters following him <newline> came in upon us for my part i was not a little surprized and by his <newline> lordliness taking him for the mayor of a town and our selves within <newline> his liberties was getting upon my feet. agamemnon laught to see me <newline> so concerned and bade me sit still for said he this habinas is <newline> a captain of horse a good mason and has a special faculty in making <newline> monuments. <newline>  <newline> recovered again with his words i kept my seat and wholly fixd my <newline> eye on habinas he came in drunk and lolling on his wifes shoulders <newline> with some garlands about him his face all trickling down with <newline> ointment he seated himself at the head of the table and <newline> incontinently called for wine and hot water <newline>  <newline> trimalchio was pleased with the humour and calling for a bigger <newline> glass asked him what entertainment he had whence he came <newline>  <newline> every thing said the other but thy self for my inclination was <newline> here tho so help me hercules it was all well. scissa kept a <newline> ninedays feast for his servant miscellus whom he infranchised after <newline> he was dead it is said he had a round sum in the chequer for they <newline> reckon he died worth 50000 sesterces yet this was all done in good <newline> order tho every one of us were obliged to pour half his drink on the <newline> grave. <newline>  <newline> but said trimalchio what had ye to eat ill tell ye quoth <newline> habinas as near as i can for my memory is not so good but that <newline> sometimes i forget my own name however for the first dish we had a <newline> goodly porker with a garland upon him and puddings goose giblets <newline> lambstones sweetbreads and gizzards round him there were also <newline> beets and housholdbread of his own baking for himself which i would <newline> rather have than white it makes a man strong and i never complain of <newline> what i like. the next was a cold tart with excellent warm honey and <newline> that spanish running upon it. i eat little of the tart but more of <newline> the honey i tasted also the red pulse and lupines by the advice of <newline> calvus and several apples of which i took away two in my <newline> handkerchief for if i bring home nothing to my little she slave i <newline> shall have snubs enough this dame of mine puts me often in mind of <newline> her. we had also on a sidetable the haunch of a bear which <newline> scintilla tasting ere she was aware had like to have thrown up her <newline> guts i on the other hand eat a pound of it or better for methought <newline> it tasted like boars flesh and said i if a bear eats a man why may <newline> not a man much more eat a bear to be short we had cream cheese <newline> wine boild off to a third part fryd snails chitterlings livers <newline> eggs turneps mustard and a bowl that held a gallon. dont disturb <newline> me palamedes there were also handled about a basket of sugarcakes <newline> of which we wantonly took some and sent away the gammon of bacon <newline> but tell me caius i beseech you whats the matter that fortunata <newline> sits not among us how came you to know her quoth trimalchio <newline> for till she has gotten her plate together and distributed what we <newline> leave among the servants not a sip of any thing goes into her mouth. <newline>  <newline> but unless she sits down replied habinas ill be gone and was <newline> getting up but that the word being four times given about for her <newline> she came at last in a greenish gown and a cherrycolourd stomacher <newline> beneath which might be seen her petticoat and embroidered garters <newline> then wiping her hands on her neckcloth she sate on that bed whereon <newline> scintilla the wife of habinas was and having given her a kiss told <newline> her it was in compliment to her that she was there. at length it came <newline> to this that she took off her weighty bracelets and shewed them to <newline> scintilla which she admiring she also unbuckled her garters and a <newline> network purse which she said was of the finest gold <newline>  <newline> trimalchio observed it and commanding all to be laid before him <newline> see said he this womans finery and what fools our wives make us <newline> they should be six pound and a half yet ive another of mercurys <newline> making that weighs ten and that he might not be thought to tell a <newline> lye called for his gold scales and commanded them to be weighed nor <newline> had scintilla more wit than tother for pulling a golden box out of <newline> her bosom which she called good luck she took out of it two large <newline> pearl pendants giving them in like manner to fortunata to view <newline> see quoth she what tis to have a kind husband i am sure no <newline> woman has better. what said habinas hast thou put the sham on <newline> me thou toldst me thou couldst be contented with glass beads and for <newline> this trick if i had a daughter id cut off her ears tho were there <newline> no women what were the rest worth this is to piss warm and drink <newline> cold. <newline>  <newline> mean time the women perceiving they were toucht twitterd among <newline> themselves and being got drunk fell to kissing one another one <newline> commended the mistress of the house tother the master when during <newline> this chatter habinas stealing behind fortunata gave her such a toss <newline> on the bed that her heels flew as high as her head on which she gave <newline> a squeak or two and finding her thighs bare ran her head under <newline> scintillas smock <newline>  <newline> this held a while till trimalchio calling for a second service to <newline> entertain his new guests the servants took away the tables that were <newline> before us and having brought others strewd the room with pindust <newline> mixt with vermillion and saffron and what i never saw before the <newline> dust of a lookingglass ground to powder <newline>  <newline> when immediately quoth trimalchio i could have been contented with <newline> those first dishes but since we have got other tables we must also <newline> have another service and if there be any thing worth our having <newline> bring it. <newline>  <newline> on which a spruce boy that served us with warm water began to <newline> imitate a nightingale till trimalchio giving the word a servant that <newline> waited on habinas set up another humour and as i believe commanded <newline> by his master noisd out <newline>  <newline> mean time neas had put off to sea. <newline>  <newline> nor was there ever a harsher sound yet pierced my ears for besides <newline> his disordered country tone his pitiful and starvling way of <newline> delivery he so stufft it with scraps of verses that even virgil then <newline> first disrelished me till at last so tyrd that he could hold no <newline> longer dye think said habinas this boy has learnd nothing i <newline> bred him with juglers that follow the fair nor has he his fellow <newline> whether he humours a muliteer or a jester. this neverbegood has <newline> abundance of wit hes a taylor a cook a baker a jack of all <newline> trades and but for two faults were exact to a hair hes <newline> crackbraind and snores in his sleep for that cast of his eye i <newline> value it not he looks like venus and therefore his tongue is ever <newline> running and were that eye out he were worth the money i gave for <newline> him. <newline>  <newline> on which scintilla interrupting him told him he was a naughty man <newline> for not telling all his servants good qualities hes a pimp said <newline> he if not worse but ill take care he be branded for that. <newline>  <newline> trimalchio laught and said he knew he was a cappadocian that never <newline> beguiled himself of any thing and so help me hercules i commend <newline> him for t when will you find such another but scintilla you must <newline> not be jealous believe me and i know you too may i so enjoy the <newline> health you wish me as i playd at leapfrog so long with our boy <newline> that my master grew jealous and sent me to dig in the country but <newline> hold thy tongue and ill give thee a loaf. i marvel said i <newline> whether they be all mashd together or made of loam for in a <newline> saturnal at rome my self saw the like imaginary shew of a supper. <newline>  <newline> nor had i scarce said it whenquoth trimalchio let me so grow in <newline> estate not bulk as my cook made all of this out of one hog there is <newline> not an excellenter fellow than himself he shall if he please make <newline> ye a poll of ling of a sows tripe a woodculver of fat bacon a <newline> turtle of a spring of pork and a hen of a collar of brawn and <newline> therefore of my own fancy i gave him a name proper to him for he is <newline> called ddalus and because he understands his business i had <newline> choppingknives of the best steel brought him from rome and with <newline> that calling for them he turnd them over and admiring them <newline> offered us the liberty of trying their edge on his cheek <newline>  <newline> on this came in two servants as quarrelling about their collars at <newline> which each of them had a large earthen pot hanging and when <newline> trimalchio determined the matter between them neither of them stood <newline> to his sentence but fell to clublaw and broke each others pots <newline>  <newline> this drunken presumption put us out of order yet casting an eye on <newline> the combatants we saw oisters and scallops running from the pots and <newline> another boy receiving them in a charger which he carried round the <newline> guests <newline>  <newline> nor was the cooks ingenuity short of the rest for he brought us a <newline> dish of grilld snails on a silver gridiron and with a shrill <newline> unpleasant voice sang as he went. i am ashamd of what followd <newline> for what was never heard of till then the boys came in with a bason <newline> of liquid perfumes and first binding our legs ancles and feet with <newline> garlands anointed them with it and put the rest into the wine vessel <newline> and the lamps <newline>  <newline> and now fortunata began to dance and scintillas hands went faster <newline> than her tongue when quoth trimalchio sit down philargyrus i give <newline> ye leave and you carrio because you are a greenribbonman and you <newline> minophilus bid your comrade do the like what shall i say more the <newline> family so crowded upon us that we were almost thrust off our beds <newline> and who should be seated above me but the cook who had made a goose <newline> of a hog all stinking of pickle and kitchenstuff nor yet content <newline> that he sate amongst us he fell immediately to personate thespis the <newline> tragedian and dare his master to a wager which of them two should win <newline> the prize next wrestling <newline>  <newline> trimalchio abashd at the challenge my friends said he even <newline> servants are men and however oppressd by ill luck sucked the same <newline> milk our selves did and for mine it shall not be long ere i make <newline> them free without prejudice to my self to be short i enfranchise all <newline> of them by my last will and testament <newline>  <newline> i give philargus a country farm and his shecomrade to carrio an <newline> island with a twentieth part of my moveables a bed and its <newline> furniture for i make fortunata my heiress whom i recommend to all my <newline> friends and publish what i have done to the end my family may so <newline> love me now as if i were dead. <newline>  <newline> all thanked their master for his kindness and he as having forgotten <newline> trifles called for a copy of his will which he read from one end to <newline> the other the family all the while sighing and sobbing afterwards <newline> turning to habinas tell me my best of friends said he do you go <newline> on with my monument as i directed ye i earnestly entreat ye that at <newline> the feet of my statue you carve me my little bitch as also garlands <newline> and ointments and all the battles i have been in that by your <newline> kindness i may live when i am dead be sure too that it have an <newline> hundred feet as it fronts the highway and as it looks towards the <newline> fields two hundred i will also that there be all sorts of fruit and <newline> vines round my ashes and that in great abundance for it is a gross <newline> mistake to furnish houses for the living and take no care of those we <newline> are to abide in for ever and therefore in the first place i will <newline> have it engraven <newline>  <newline> let no heir of mine pretend to this monument. <newline>  <newline> and that i may receive no injury after i am dead ill have a codicil <newline> annext to my will whereby ill appoint one of my freedmen the keeper <newline> of this monument that the people make not a houseofoffice of it <newline> make me also i beseech you on this my monument ships under full <newline> sail and my self in my robes sitting on the bench with five gold <newline> rings on my fingers and scattering moneys among the common people <newline> for you know i have ordered ye a funeral feast and twopence apiece <newline> in money. you shall also if you think fit shape me some of these <newline> beds we now sit on and all the people making their court to me. on <newline> my right hand place my fortunatas statue with a dove in one hand <newline> and leading a little dog in her girdle with the other as also my <newline> cicero and large wine vessels close corkd that the wine dont run <newline> out and yet carve one of them as broken and a boy weeping over it <newline> as also a sundial in the middle that whoever comes to see <newline> whatsaclock may read my name whether he will or no. and lastly <newline> have a special consideration whether you think this epitaph sufficient <newline> enough <newline>  <newline> here rests caius pompeius trimalchio patron of the learned. a troop <newline> of horse was decreed him without suing for and might have been a <newline> senator would he have accepted it. a pious man honest valiant and <newline> true to his friend. he raised himself from little or nothing but <newline> left behind him a prodigious estate yet never heard a philosopher <newline> farewell to you also. <newline>  <newline> this said trimalchio wept plentifully fortunata wept habinas wept <newline> and the whole family set up a cry as it had been his funeral nay i <newline> also whind for company when quoth trimalchio since you know we <newline> must die why dont we live while we may so let me live my self to <newline> see you happy as if we plunge our selves in the bath we shall not <newline> repent it at my peril be it ill lead the way for this room is <newline> grown as hot as an oven. say you so quoth habinas nor am i <newline> afraid to make two days of one and therewith got up barefoot and <newline> followd trimalchio <newline>  <newline> i on the other hand turning to ascyltos asked him what he thought of <newline> it for if i but see the bath i shall swoon away. <newline>  <newline> lets lagg behind then said he and whilst they are getting in <newline> well slip off in the crowd. <newline>  <newline> the contrivance pleased us and so gito leading the way through the <newline> portico we came to the last gate where a chained dog bolted upon us <newline> so furiously that ascyltos fell into the fishpond. i who had been <newline> frighted at the painted dog and now gotten as drunk as ascyltos <newline> while i endeavoured to get hold of him fell in my self at last the <newline> porters coming in saved us for he quieted the dog and drew us out <newline> but gito like a sharp rascal delivered himself for whatever had <newline> been given him at supper to carry home with him he threw it the dog <newline> and that mollified him <newline>  <newline> but when shivering with cold we desired the porter to let us out <newline> youre mistaken said he if ye think to go out the same way ye <newline> came in for no guest ere yet did they came in at one gate and are <newline> let out by another. <newline>  <newline> in this sad pickle what should we do we found ourselves in a new <newline> kind of labyrinth and for bathing wed enough of it already <newline> however necessity enforcing us we prayd him to show us the way to <newline> the bath and gito having hung out our cloaths a drying in the porch <newline> we entred the bath which was somewhat narrow and sunk in the earth <newline> not unlike a rainwater cistern in this stood trimalchio starknaked <newline> nor could we avoid his filthy tricks for he said nothing was better <newline> than to bathe in a crowd and that every place had in times past been <newline> a grindinghouse. being weary at length he sate down and provokd <newline> by the noisiness of the bath set up his drunken throat and fell a <newline> murdering some songs of menecrates as they that understood him told <newline> us <newline>  <newline> other guests ran round the cistern with their arms across and made a <newline> clamorous slap with their mouths others either tryd to take up a <newline> ring from the pavement with their hands bound behind them or putting <newline> one knee to the ground to kiss their great toes backward <newline>  <newline> while they thus entertained one another we went into the hothouse <newline> that had been heated for trimalchio and being now recovered of our <newline> drunkenness were brought into another room where fortunata had set <newline> out a fresh entertainment. above the lamps i observed some womens <newline> gewgaws. the tables were massy silver the earthen ware double gilt <newline> and a conduit running with wine when quoth trimalchio this day my <newline> friends a servant of mine opened a barbers shop hes well to pass <newline> a thrifty fellow and a favourite of mine come let the floor have a <newline> drink as well as our selves and for our part well sit to it till <newline> daylight. <newline>  <newline> while he was yet speaking a cock crowd at which trimalchio grew <newline> disordered and commanded the wine to be thrown under table and <newline> sprinkle the larnps with it then changing a ring to his right hand <newline> it is not for nothing said he this trumpeter has given us notice <newline> for either the house should be on fire or one of the neighbourhood <newline> will kill himself far from us be it and therefore whoever brings me <newline> this discoverer ill give him a reward. <newline>  <newline> when immediately a cock was brought in and trimalchio commanding to <newline> have him drest he was torn in pieces by that exquisite cook who a <newline> little before had make us fish and fowl of a hog and put in a <newline> stewpan and while ddalus was taking a lusty draught fortunata <newline> ground pepper <newline>  <newline> after which trimalchio taking some of the banquet bid the waiters go <newline> to supper and let others supply their places <newline>  <newline> whereupon came in another rank of servants and as the former going <newline> cryd out farewell caius those coming in cryd out sit thou <newline> merry caius. <newline>  <newline> and here our mirth first began to be disturbd for a beautiful boy <newline> coming in among those new servants trimalchio plucked the boy to him <newline> and did nothing but kiss him over and over whereupon fortunata to <newline> maintain her right began to rail at trimalchio called him pitiful <newline> fellow one that could not bridle his lust shame and dishonour to an <newline> honest woman and a very dog. trimalchio on the other hand all <newline> confounded and vexd at her taunts threw a goblet at her head she <newline> fell a roaring as if she had lost an eye and clapt both her hands <newline> before it <newline>  <newline> scintilla also stood amazed and covered fortunata all trembling as <newline> she was in her bosom the boy also put a cold pitcher to her cheek <newline> on which she leaned and made a lamentable wailing and blubbing <newline>  <newline> but trimalchio quite contrary for said he what am i the better <newline> for this graceless buttock tis well known i took her out of a <newline> bawdyhouse and made her an honest woman but now blown up like a <newline> frog she bespatters herself a very block no woman but this poor boy <newline> born in a hovel never dreams of palaces. may my good genius so <newline> befriend me as ill bring down this seeming saint but in her actions <newline> a whore rampant as inconsiderable as she makes me i might have had a <newline> wife with two hundred and fifty pistols you know i dont lye but she <newline> was somewhat in years and agatho the sweet oilman persuaded me not <newline> to let my name run out when instead of doing good to her i have put <newline> a thorn in my own foot but ill have a care that she dig me not out <newline> of my grave with her nails and that she may know what ill do at <newline> present i will not habinas have you put her statue in my monument <newline> that i have no words with her when i am dead nay that she may know i <newline> am able to plague her she shall not so much as kiss me when i die. <newline> after this ratling habinas entreated him to give over his anger <newline> theres none of us all said he but some time or other does amiss <newline> we are but men not gods. weeping scintilla said the same called <newline> him caius and by his own good nature besought him to be pacified <newline>  <newline> trimalchio not able to hold tears any longer i beg of you habinas <newline> said he and as you wish to enjoy what you have gotten if i have <newline> done any thing without cause spit in my face i kissd the boy tis <newline> true not for his beauty but that hes a hopeful thrifty lad he has <newline> several sentences by heart can read a book at first sight saves <newline> money out of his days provision has a binn of his own to keep it and <newline> two drinking cups and does he not deserve to be in my eye but <newline> fortunata forsooth will not have it so your bandy legs wont away <newline> with it. be content with your own thou shekite and dont disquiet <newline> me thou harlotry or otherwise thoult find what i am thou knowest <newline> well enough if i once set ont tis immoveable. but well remember <newline> the living <newline>  <newline> come my friends lets see how merry ye can be for in my time i <newline> have been no better than your selves but by my own industry i am what <newline> i am tis the heart makes a man all the rest is but stuff. i buy <newline> cheap and sell dear another man may sell ye other things but i enjoy <newline> my self and thou dunghillraker are thou yet gruntling ill make ye <newline> hereafter do it for somewhat <newline>  <newline> but as i was saying my frugality brought the fortune i have i came <newline> out of asia no taller than this candlestick and daily measured my <newline> self by it and that i might get a beard the sooner rubbd my lips <newline> with the candlegrease yet i kept ganymede to my master fourteen <newline> years nor is any thing dishonourable that the master commands and <newline> the same time contented my mistress ye know what i mean ill say no <newline> more for i am no boaster. by this means as the gods would have it <newline> the governing the house was committed to me and nothing was done but <newline> by my guidance what need many words he made me jointheir with <newline> csar and i had by it a senators estate but no man thinks he has <newline> enough and i had a mighty desire to turn merchant. not to detain you <newline> longer i built five ships freighted them with wines which at that <newline> time were as dear as gold and sent them to rome youll think i <newline> desird to have it so all my ships founderd at sea tis a great <newline> truth no story neptune swallowed me in one day three hundred <newline> thousand sesterties. do ye think i broke upon t so help me <newline> hercules no the loss was but a fleabite for as if there had been <newline> no such thing i built others larger better and more fortunate than <newline> the former so that every one called me a man of courage. as you know <newline> a great ship carries a great deal of force i loaded them again with <newline> wine bacon beans unguents planes and here fortunata shewed her <newline> affection for she sold what she had nay her very cloaths and put a <newline> round sum in my pocket tho yet it was but a pig of my own sow. what <newline> the gods will is quickly done i got an hundred thousand sesterties by <newline> the voyage and forthwith redeemed the lands my patron had left me <newline> built me a house bought cattle to sell them again and whatever i <newline> went about gathered like a snowball but when i grew richer than all <newline> the country besides i took up and from a merchant turnd usurer and <newline> bought servants <newline>  <newline> thus resolved to give over trading a certain astrologer that chancd <newline> to light on this village would have persuaded me to the contrary. he <newline> was a grcian his name srapa one that held correspondence <newline> with the gods. he told me a deal that i had forgotten and laid <newline> everything before me from top to bottom he knew all i had within me <newline> and told me what i had the night before to supper youd have thought <newline> he had livd with me all his life <newline>  <newline> i beseech you habinas for i think you was there he told me the <newline> intrigue between my mistress and me that i had but ill luck at <newline> friends that no one ever made me a return of my kindnesses that i <newline> had large possessions but nourished a viper in my bosom why should i <newline> not tell you all i have by his account thirty years four months <newline> and two days yet to live and in a short time shall have another <newline> estate left me <newline>  <newline> thus my fortuneteller. but if i can join my lands here to those in <newline> apulia i shall do well enough in the mean and while mercury is my <newline> guardian i have built this house it was once you know a pitiful <newline> cabin but now as magnificent as a temple it has four dining rooms <newline> twenty bedchambers two marble porticoes a gallery above stairs my <newline> own apartment another for this viper a very good porters lodge and <newline> the house capable of receiving a thousand guests to be short when <newline> ever scaurus comes this way he had rather lodge here than at his own <newline> house tho it lie to the seaward and many other conveniences it has <newline> which ill shew you by and by. believe me he that has a penny in his <newline> purse is worth a penny have and you shall be esteemed. and so your <newline> friend once no better than a frog is now a king <newline>  <newline> and now stichus bring me the furniture in which i design to be <newline> carried to my funeral pile bring also the unguent and some of that <newline> pot which i ordered for the cleansing my bones. <newline>  <newline> stichus lingered not but brought in a white coverlet and robe of <newline> state and prayd us to try if they were not fine wooll and well <newline> woven. and see you stichus said trimalchio smiling that neither <newline> mice nor moths come at them for if they do ill burn you alive. i <newline> will be brought out in pomp that all the people may speak well of <newline> me. <newline>  <newline> with that opening a glass bottle of spicknard he caused us all to be <newline> anointed and i hope said he it will do as much good when i am <newline> dead as it does while i am living then commanding the wine vessels <newline> to be filled again fausie said he you are invited to my funeral <newline> feast. we by this time nauseated were ready to vomit trimalchio <newline> also was gotten confoundedly drunk when behold a new interlude he <newline> called for the coronets to come in and underset with pillows and <newline> stretching himself at length on the bed suppose me said he now <newline> dead say somewhat i beseech you in praise of me. <newline>  <newline> whereupon the coronets sounded as it had been at a funeral but one <newline> above the rest a servant of that freedman of trimalchios that was <newline> best conditiond of em all made such a thundring that it raisd the <newline> neighbourhood on which the watch thinking the house was on fire <newline> broke open the gate and making an uproar after their manner ran in <newline> with water and hatchets when finding so fair an opportunity we gave <newline> agamemnon the slip and scamperd off as if it had been a real fire1embed',\n",
